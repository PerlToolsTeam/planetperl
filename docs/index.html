  Intro
</h2>

<p>Sometimes bad things bring us good opportunities.</p>

<p>This was the case this year with Covid and “The Perl Conference”. This major yearly Perl conference became available to remote people and therefore renamed “The Perl and Raku Conference In The Cloud”.</p>

<p>The event was well announced and we were able to pay to support the organizational costs (what I have done), but it was even not mandatory (free broadcast on youtube).</p>

<p>I was very excited by the planning, I remember having difficulties to choose between talks !</p>

<p><a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--5bw9U_QZ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/16t9402t3zne0djyif1a.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--5bw9U_QZ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/16t9402t3zne0djyif1a.png" alt="Mamy"></a><br>
(/me trying to choose between an amazing and a wonderful talk topic)</p>

<h2>
  <a href="#here-we-are" class="anchor">
  </a>
  Here we are
</h2>

<p>Then finally the day has come and I was able to join Perl folks with the password shared one or two days before.</p>

<p>I was waiting with decent expectation (to not say excitement) for the first talk.</p>

<p>It consisted in a word from organizers followed by a keynote from Perl pumpking “Sawyer X”.</p>

<p><a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--fepg5jcJ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/cfgubinbjw78th92eocs.jpeg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--fepg5jcJ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/cfgubinbjw78th92eocs.jpeg" alt="Sawyer X"></a></p>

<p>What could be best as an luxury “aperitif” 😄</p>

<p>I was ready, well preapared, first TPC, first talk, let’s go.</p>

<p>It was during this talk that was <strong>announced Perl 7</strong> !!</p>

<p>OMG, I was immediatly like this :</p>

<p><a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--8-25Li7z--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/698bnbc6v6ftrnjpxfr3.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--8-25Li7z--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/698bnbc6v6ftrnjpxfr3.jpg" alt="Surprised"></a></p>

<p>Everybody was very excited and happy all around, like me.</p>

<p>This was my first TPC and the first talk I attended, later on I wondered myself if it was a bit “my fault” 😄</p>

<p>If I decide to attend another TPC, what will be announced ? That we discovered aliens ?</p>

<p>Later on reddit I noticed this fun comment from <strong>perlancar</strong> :<br>
<a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--tswpVbFk--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/kq0msv1hrk2yku1ik5l1.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--tswpVbFk--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/kq0msv1hrk2yku1ik5l1.png" alt="perlancar"></a></p>

<h2>
  <a href="#other-talks-in-bulk" class="anchor">
  </a>
  Other talks, in bulk
</h2>

<p>As I said I followed all the slots during all the TPC days. Was a bit rushy because often talks ended just when next one started (but it could not overlap because of the same room).</p>

<p>I really loved some very technical talks like the ones from <strong>Graham Ollis</strong> on <strong>FFI</strong> and <strong>Wasm</strong> (but I’m interested in Perl “native” stuff like aliens and xs so that’s not a surprise 😄)</p>

<p><a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--YZSTSUCh--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/rbhw8o6pfh12c4376r5i.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--YZSTSUCh--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/rbhw8o6pfh12c4376r5i.png" alt="FFI Graham"></a></p>

<p>I’m also very interested in the way Perl folks put such lot of efforts into quality (CPAN testers and perl5 smokers etc…) and I enjoyed the talk about quality from <strong>Jim Keenan</strong>. </p>

<p><a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--a1l7Lfr0--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/haalrp9sh4msqgopcuu2.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--a1l7Lfr0--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/haalrp9sh4msqgopcuu2.png" alt="Golden Mic"></a></p>

<p>Please note the golden mic !</p>

<p><a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--BfXakGEM--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/x8qrr46av5vf7nvzfx7x.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--BfXakGEM--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/x8qrr46av5vf7nvzfx7x.png" alt="THE golden Mic"></a></p>

<p>There was a lightening talk on <a href="https://pullrequest.club/hello">Pull Request Club</a>, do you know this ? If not you should join !</p>

<p><a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--tJqWv_Ya--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/g39udabfskcidzc2tfpp.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--tJqWv_Ya--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/g39udabfskcidzc2tfpp.png" alt="Alt Text"></a></p>

<p>Multiple talks discussed about “Continuous Integration” topic that I follow for my day to day job, and it was very interesting. One of them was from <strong>Olaf Alders</strong>.</p>

<p><a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Fiy-s4oH--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/387qol9p0vxbsd87tefc.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Fiy-s4oH--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/387qol9p0vxbsd87tefc.png" alt="Alt Text"></a></p>

<p>I was also very impressed by the lightning talk about <a href="https://openqa.opensuse.org/">OpenQA</a> project.</p>

<p>One guy made a psychedelic talk about command line tools, I don’t understood what it does exactly but that was crazy.</p>

<p>I also joined several “BOF” to talk or ask questions about topics like <strong>Perl 7</strong> or <strong>TPF missions</strong>.</p>

<h2>
  <a href="#the-damian-conway-show" class="anchor">
  </a>
  The Damian Conway Show
</h2>

<p>Later, there was the keynote from <strong>Damian Conway</strong>.</p>

<p>People said you should prepare for it and come with a beer and peanuts. That’s totally true.</p>

<p>Was not that simple to explain to my wife that I open a beer in front of my computer… at midnight (was that time France), but was definitely worth to do it 😄</p>

<p><a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ex5W0EIL--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/21gqxw8z9k0caa4f5u3z.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ex5W0EIL--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/21gqxw8z9k0caa4f5u3z.png" alt="Damian Harold"></a></p>

<p>This talk completely turned my brain (like the psychedelic one that I discussed earlier) 😃</p>

<p>All people in the associated chat become totally crazy also and I laught a lot with fun and smart comments.</p>

  <a href="#conclusion" class="anchor">

  Conclusion
</h2>

<p>This TPC was my first Perl conference and it was a wonderful experience for me.</p>

<p>I wanted to thank all organizers like Todd Rinaldo and all others.</p>

<p>I also wanted to highlight Geoffrey Avery that was handling the BOF and/or lightning talks (don’t remember well).</p>

<p><a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--sDmnJCna--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/xbkbyz8ou263yvhs2zaz.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--sDmnJCna--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/xbkbyz8ou263yvhs2zaz.png" alt="Geoffrey Avery"></a></p>

<p>He said something poignant around the end of the TPC like : “dear newcomers, please don’t disappear”.</p>

<p>I had so much fun that I personally promised myself to join again as much Perl conferences as possible.</p>

We thank the TPF sponsors to make this grant possible.</p>

<pre>
This mainly consisted in tracking down a (harmless as it turned out)
off-by-one error in Cwd.xs, which I thought was being flagged up by
valgrind. As it turned out, the valgrind report was a false positive caused
by a bug in valgrind when perl is built with -D_FORTIFY_SOURCE, and I
found the Cwd bug by manual code inspection of the area complained about
by valgrind!

<p>You are given an array of positive integers <code>@N</code>.</p>

<p>Write a script to return an array <code>@M</code> where <code>$M[i]</code> is the product of all elements of <code>@N</code> except the index <code>$N[i]</code>.</p>

<p>This is relatively straight forward. I calculate the product of all the numbers using List::Util's <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/List::Util#product">product</a> function. For those that follow my posts, I tend to use only CPAN modules that are in core, like List::Util.</p>

<p>I then use the <a href="https://perldoc.perl.org/functions/map">map</a> function to loop over the numbers, diving the product by the number to give the solution.</p>

  My solution

<p>Initially I was quite stumped about the way to solve it. I was thinking I'd need some sort of counter to know how many values I would need to take and in which direction. After an hour of thinking about it (while watching the television), I figured out a reasonably clean solution. It will be interesting to see what other Team PWC members come up with.</p>

<p>It can be broken down to the following steps.</p>

<ol>
<li>Parse the input into an array of arrays, check that all rows are even.</li>
<li>Create an array <code>@used</code> that is the same size as the input array.</li>
<li>Have an array <code>@directions</code> that map the x &amp; y movements. For example <code>[1, 0]</code> means to move down.</li>
<li>Starting at the top left moving right add the value at that position to the <code>@solutions</code> array, and mark that position as used.</li>
<li>If the next position is out of bounds of the array or is a value that has been used, switch directions. Continue this pattern until the <code>@solutions</code> array is completed.</li>
<li>Output the values to the screen.</li>
</ol>

<p>I put together a web page for <a href="https://cpan-digger.perlmaven.com/">CPAN Digger</a> where you can see the 100 most recently uploaded CPAN modules. The goal is to locate the ones that don't link to their VCS in their META.json file. Try to locate the public VCS and add the link. I also would like to encourage the CPAN authors to set up their <a href="https://cpandashboard.com/">CPAN Dashboard</a> that was created by Dave Cross.</p>

     <div class="card-body">       <div class="card-text">
        <p>The other day I wanted to send my friend some silly emojis on LINE and so I updated my <a href="https://www.lemoda.net/tools/unicode/index.html">flaky old Unicode browser</a> to the new-fangled Unicode with values above 0x10000, so that I could fetch the Emojis, which start <a href="https://www.lemoda.net/tools/unicode/index.html?char=1F348">around here</a>. The thing also features a perl script which fetches values from <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Unicode::UCD">Unicode::UCD</a> using the <code>charinfo</code> function. I also updated to Perl 5.32 around the same time. Now the funny thing was that I started getting all kinds of errors about invalid JSON in the browser console. My Perl script was sending something of the form <code>{... "script":Common ...}</code> from my module JSON::Create, which is not valid JSON due to not having quotes around <code>Common</code>, and obviously my module was faulty.</p>

<p>Investigating the fault led me into the XS (C) code of my module where the value part of the JSON thought that the value associated with the <code>script</code> key in the hash reference returned by <code>charinfo</code> was of the form <code>SVt_PVIV</code>. <code>PV</code> means "pointer value" which is basically a string, and <code>IV</code> means "integer value", you can probably guess what that is supposed to contain.</p>

<p>My stupid module assumed that the string in an <code>SVt_PVIV</code> was just a representation of the IV part, so it just printed the PV as a string without quotes, leading to the above Common appearing. But it doesn't seem to be so. Is it some kind of "dual variable"? It turned out that the IV part wasn't even valid, so forcing it to treat the <code>SVt_PVIV</code> as an IV didn't work. <a href="https://metacpan.org/source/BKB/JSON-Create-0.27_01/json-create-perl.c#L1442">The solution at the moment</a> is to test with something called SvIOK whether the IV part is OK then treat it as a string if not.</p>

<p>The mysterious part for me is why is the <code>script</code> value an SVt_PVIV in the first place? Answers on a postcard, or comment below if you prefer.</p>

<p>I tried to replicate this bug for testing purposes using Scalar::Util's <code>dualvar</code>, but that creates an SVt_PVNV (floating point/string combo), which my daft module treated differently again.</p>

            </div> <!-- card-header -->
     <div class="card-body">       <div class="card-text">
        <p>In version 0.27 of JSON::Create I added a new <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/distribution/JSON-Create/lib/JSON/Create.pod#indent">indentation feature</a>. This was added basically out of necessity. Originally the purpose of the module was sending short bits of JSON over the internet, but I've been using JSON more and more for processing data too. I've spent quite a long time working on <a href="https://www.qhanzi.com/">a web site for recognition of Chinese</a>, and I've been using JSON more and more extensively. The basic data file for the web site is a 168 megabyte JSON file. Not indenting this kind of file makes for "interesting" problems if one accidentally opens it in an editor or on a terminal screen, a million characters all on one line tends to confuse the best-written text reading utilities. So after years of suffering the relief is tremendous, and now I have tab-based indentation in JSON::Create.</p>

<p>Originally I thought that I should make all kinds of customisable indentation possible, but then it occurred to me that basically any fool armed with a regular expression could easily alter the indentation however they want to. I put <a href="https://fastapi.metacpan.org/source/BKB/JSON-Create-0.27/examples/indent-format.pl">a simple example in the documentation</a>.</p>

<p>I decided to force myself to work with an artificial constraint as a way fo forcing a little bit more creativity in my solution. When I first looked at this problem I immediately thought “ok, first thing should be to sort the list”. Based on that first impression my self-imposed constraint was to “solve this without using a sort”!</p>
<p>What I did can be summarized as follows: 1. Find the minimum and maximum numbers in the given list. 2. Starting with the minimum number generate test sequences by incrementing upwards towards the maximum list value. 3. As each new element of the test sequence is added test to see if it is in the original list. 4. If it is in the list, good, keep going. 5. If it is not in the list then save the test sequence generated up to that point and continue with a new test sequence. 6. Return all successful test sequences and determine the longest one.</p>
<p>The most blatant inefficiency to this approach is when lists are sparse. For example, suppose we are given <code>(2, 100000000, 3, 4, 5)</code> then we would be iterating from <code>2</code> to <code>100000000</code>. An approach using a sorted list would basically need only loop over the elements of the list, checking to see if the next element was 1 larger than the previous.</p>

<p>Unlike Part 1 I did not necessarily have a self-imposed constraint other than to try and be as creative as possible. I’ll only know when I look at other submitted solutions if I was really all that relatively clever or not!</p>
<p>Here I do the following: 1. Check the size of the given matrix 2. Test the matrix for all possible sub-matrix sizes. 3. For all found sub-matrices determine the largest one.</p>
<p>For checking the presence of sub-matrices I <a href="https://perldoc.perl.org/functions/join">join</a> the rows into strings and then use <a href="https://perldoc.perl.org/functions/index">index</a> to see if they appear in a given row or not. To determine if a sub-matrix is the largest I compare the areas of the “rectangles”.</p>       </div><!-- card-text -->     </div>

            </div> <!-- card-header -->
     <div class="card-body">       <div class="card-text"><p>I've been using <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub pages</a> to host static web sites for a few years. I wrote <a href="https://blog.dave.org.uk/2018/08/simple-static-websites-with-github-pages.html">a brief introduction on how to do that</a> a couple of years ago.</p>

<p>However, very few pages are completely static. So I still had to host many of my web sites in places where I could execute the code that was used to run the site. But in the last couple of weeks, I've realised that there is another type of site that can be successfully hosted on GitHub pages using <a href="https://github.com/features/actions">GitHub Actions</a>. I call these "semi-static" sites. It would probably help if I explained what I mean by this term. I'll start by giving an example.</p>

<p>I've written before about my <a href="https://dev.to/davorg/your-cpan-dashboard-92">CPAN Dashboard site</a>. It's a site that allows <a href="https://metacpan.org/">CPAN</a> authors to monitor the various continuous integration services that they use to develop their code. (For those of you who haven't heard of it - CPAN is the "Comprehensive Perl Archive Network - the site where Perl programmers can find thousands of libraries that extend the Perl language).</p>

<p>This site is <em>mostly</em> static. There's a page for each author who uses the site. Those pages are mostly taken up by a big table. Each row in the table contains data about one of the author's modules. There are links to the code repo and the module's page on CPAN, the version number and release date of the most recent version of the module and a series of badges indicating the status of the module on various CI services. The list of an author's modules is generated by making a call to the <a href="https://github.com/metacpan/metacpan-api/blob/master/docs/API-docs.md">MetaCPAN API</a>.</p>

<p>The site currently has two other pages: the home page (which basically lists the authors using the site) and a page telling authors how they can add themselves to the site (which is by sending a pull request to <a href="https://github.com/davorg/dashboard">the repo that hosts the site</a>).</p>

<p>As I say, the site is mostly static. There are only a few ways that the site can change.</p>

<ul>
<li>I change the information in one of the static pages</li>
<li>I change the formatting of site</li>
<li>A new author sends a pull request to add themself to the site</li>
<li>An author who uses the site releases a new module (or gives up ownership of an existing one)</li>
<li>An author who uses the site releases a new version of module (meaning that the last-released date needs to change)</li>
</ul>

<p>There is a single program in the repo that can be used to rebuild the site in all of these circumstances.</p>

<p>If I change the site in some way (the first two items in the list), obviously I know that this change has been made and can run the regeneration program and commit the regenerated version.</p>

<p>If an author sends a pull request to add themself to the site, I can merge the site, then pull down the latest version and regenerate it to add the page for the new user. But it would be nicer if I just had to merge the pull request and the rebuild was handled automatically.</p>

<p>But I can't know when an author adds a new module or releases a new version of a module - well not without monitoring CPAN rather more closely than I have time for. It would be better if the site is automatically rebuilt periodically (say once an hour) and checked in if something has changed. And that's what I can now do - thanks to GitHub Actions.</p>

<p>GitHub actions are configured by adding a <a href="https://yaml.org/">YAML</a> file to the <code>.github/workflows</code> directory in a code repo. The YAML configures what the action does and how it is triggered. Here's the current version of the workflow file for my <a href="https://github.com/davorg/dashboard">dashboard repo</a>:</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>name: Generate web page

      run: |
        GIT_STATUS=$(git status --porcelain)
        echo $GIT_STATUS
        git config --global user.name 'Dave Cross'
        git config --global user.email 'dave@dave.org.uk'
        git add docs/
        if [ "$GIT_STATUS" != "" ]; then git commit -m "Automated Web page generation"; fi
        if [ "$GIT_STATUS" != "" ]; then git push; fi

</div>
</div>

<p>I think it's pretty easy to understand, but let's go through it a section at a time.</p>

<p>We start with the <code>on:</code> key. That defines when the workflow will be triggered. In this case, we have three triggers.</p>

<ul>
<li>If there's a <code>push</code> to any branch (most usefully, this is triggered when I merge a pull request)</li>
<li>On a <code>cron</code> schedule. Here I run it hourly - at seven minutes past the hour</li>
<li>And <code>workflow_dispatch:</code> adds a button to the action's page in the repo. Pressing this button will run the action at any time.</li>
</ul>

<p>The next section (<code>jobs:</code>) defines what we do. We're using the build-in ability to run in a Docker image (here, we use one of the official Perl images - which adds a number of useful Perl tools to a standard Ubuntu image). We checkout the repo, install the dependencies using <code>cpanm</code> and then run the program (called <code>dashboard</code>) that regenerates the site. We then use a low-level (porcelain) <code>git</code> command to determine whether any of the files actually changed; and, if they did, we commit the changes and they will appear on the web site.</p>

<p>This solves all of my problems. If I change the site in some way and forget to regenerate it before committing, then the site will be regenerated automatically. When I merge a pull request from a new author, the site will be regenerated automatically. And the site will be regenerated automatically each hour, which will take care of the case when any of the authors' lists of modules have changed in any way.</p>

<p>So that's what I mean by a "semi-static" site. It's one where the pages stay the same most of the time, but there are a few, well-defined, events can change the contents of the site. As long as those events can be mapped onto the various triggers for GitHub actions, then the regeneration of the site can be handled automatically.</p>

<p>Here's another example. I run another site called <a href="http://perl.theplanetarium.org/">Planet Perl</a>. This is an old-school web feed aggregator. It knows about a number of web feeds about Perl programming and it combines their content into a single page (and another web feed). Once again, there is a small list of events that can change the site:</p>

<ul>
<li>I change the look and feel of the site</li>
<li>I add a new web feed (or someone submits a pull request that adds a web feed)</li>
<li>Every hour we poll all of the feeds and rebuild the site</li>
</ul>

<p>I won't go through the workflow definition again, but <a href="https://github.com/davorg/planetperl/blob/master/.github/workflows/buildsite.yml">here it is</a> if you'd like to take a look (it's actually very similar to the previous one).</p>

<p>Please let me know in the comments if you can think of any other kinds of site that this approach would work for. Or if you can suggest any improvements to my system.</p>

<p>The original version of the CPAN Dashboard workflow was sent to me by <a href="https://dev.to/szabgab">Gabor Szabo</a>. Many thanks to him for showing me how to do it.</p>

  <em>Imperative Approach</em>
</h3>

<p>I've done the same task with common lisp and golang, then I guess that I naturally follow the same logic I used in both language.</p>

<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>sort the number</li>
<li>compare between consecutive member in the list</li>
<li>concatenate the list if they are right next to each other</li>
<li>if not, start a new sequence</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

<p>and I need to add handy dummy member at the tail of the list</p>

<p>here is the code.<br>

<div><br /></div><div>Pretty straight-forward.</div>

<div><br /></div><div>Some ideas: There should be some more efficient algorithms, maybe similar to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counting_sort">counting sort</a> , if the range of integers is given and the integers are "dense" enough.</div>

<div>---</div>
<div>Since this is a task on list, I write Lisp codes after a few weeks&nbsp; (<u>checking: last time is Challenge #80, oh!</u> )
and it is probably a bad implementation as a lot of global variables 
have been used... Stop confession. The most interesting point is making <tt>(50 48 301 4 51 3 2 49 29 300)</tt> as <tt>((2 3 4) (29) (48 49 50 51) (300 301))</tt>
 -- from an unsorted list to a list of sorted lists which each are 
composed of consecutive integers --. Interested readers may go to GitHub
 to see the full code.</div><div><br /></div>

<h4>Task 2 Largest Rectangle</h4>

<div>I think my codes are not the most optimized.</div><div><br /></div>

<div>There is a four-layer <tt>for</tt> loops. In order to get the largest rectangle as early as we can, I put <tt>reverse</tt> for the latter two layers <tt>for</tt> loop. <br /></div><div><br /></div>

</tt></div>

<div><tt>all_ones(\@mat, $p1, $p2, $p3)</tt> checks the <tt>$p1</tt>-th to <tt>$p2</tt>-th column terms on the <tt>$p3</tt>-th row.</div>

<div><br /></div><div>As said, I want to get the largest rectangle as soon as possible.

<div><tt>

<p><em>Spoiler Alert:</em> This weekly challenge deadline is due in a few days (November 22, 2020). This blog post offers some solutions to this challenge, please don’t read on if you intend to complete the challenge on your own.</p>

<h2>Task 1: Longest Consecutive Sequences</h2>

<p><em>You are given an unsorted array of integers @N.</em></p>

<p><em>Write a script to find the longest consecutive sequence. Print 0 if none sequence found.</em></p>

<p><em>Example 1:</em></p>

<pre><code>Input: @N = (100, 4, 50, 3, 2)
Output: (2, 3, 4)
</code></pre>

<p><em>Example 2:</em></p>

<pre><code>Input: @N = (20, 30, 10, 40, 50)
Output: 0
</code></pre>

<p><em>Example 3:</em></p>

<pre><code>Input: @N = (20, 19, 9, 11, 10)
Output: (9, 10, 11)
</code></pre>

<p>We&#8217;re given an unsorted array, but there is nothing preventing us from starting by sorting the array. Once the input is sorted, the solution is quite easy. Note that, if Raku or Perl did not have a built-in <code>sort</code> function, the first thing I would do is probably to implement a <code>sort</code> subroutine. I have shown elsewhere that a quick sort or merge sort subroutine can be written in about half a dozen code lines, both in Raku and in Perl, with a functional programming approach. For example, this is a quick sort implementation in Raku:</p>

<pre><code>sub quicksort (@input) {
    return @input if @input.elems &lt;= 1;
    my $pivot = @input[@input.elems div 2];
    return flat quicksort(grep {$_ &lt; $pivot}, @input), 
        (grep {$_ == $pivot}, @input), 
        quicksort(grep {$_ &gt; $pivot}, @input);
}
</code></pre>

<h3>Longest Consecutive Sequences in Raku</h3>

<p>We use three input arrays for our tests. For each test case, we simply sort the input array and scan the sorted results for consecutive sequences. Consecutive sequences are stored in the <code>@sequences</code> array of arrays and we finally display the longest sequence:</p>

<pre><code>use v6;

my @tests = [ 100, 4, 50, 3, 2 ],
            [ 20, 30, 10, 40, 50 ],
            [ 20, 19, 9, 11, 10 ];

for @tests -&gt; @t {
    my @in = sort @t;
    my $last = @in[0];
    my @sequences;
    my $index = 0;
    push @sequences[$index], $last;
    for 1..@in.end -&gt; $i {
        my $current = @in[$i];
        $index++ if $current != $last + 1;
        push @sequences[$index], $current;
        $last = $current;
    }
    my @sorted_seq = sort { $^b.elems &lt;=&gt; $^a.elems }, @sequence;
    if @sorted_seq[0] &gt; 1 {
        say @sorted_seq[0];
    } else {
        say 0;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>This displays the following output:</p>

<pre><code>[2 3 4]
0
[9 10 11]
</code></pre>

<h3>Longest Consecutive Sequences in Perl</h3>

<p>In this Perl version, we also use three input arrays for our tests. For each test case, we simply sort the input array and scan the sorted results for consecutive sequences. Consecutive sequences are stored in the <code>@sequences</code> array of arrays and we simply output the longest sequence:</p>

<pre><code>use strict;
use warnings;
use feature "say";
use Data::Dumper;

my @tests = ( [ 100, 4, 50, 3, 2 ],
              [ 20, 30, 10, 40, 50 ],
              [ 20, 19, 9, 11, 10 ]
            );

for my $t_ref (@tests) {
    my @in = sort { $a &lt;=&gt; $b } @$t_ref;
    my $last = $in[0];
    my @sequences;
    my $index = 0;
    push @{$sequences[$index]}, $last;
    for my $i (1..$#in) {
        my $current = $in[$i];
        $index++ if $current != $last + 1;
        push @{$sequences[$index]}, $current;
        $last = $current;
    }
    my @sorted_seq = sort { scalar @$b &lt;=&gt; scalar @$a } @sequences;
    if (scalar @{$sorted_seq[0]} &gt; 1) {
        say "@{$sorted_seq[0]}";
    } else {
        say 0;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>This is the output displayed by this script:</p>

<pre><code>$ perl longest-seq.pl
2 3 4
0
9 10 11
</code></pre>

<h2>Task 2: Largest Rectangle</h2>

<p><em>You are given matrix m x n with 0 and 1.</em></p>

<p><em>Write a script to find the largest rectangle containing only 1. Print 0 if none found.</em></p>

<p><em>Example 1:</em></p>

<pre><code>Input:
    [ 0 0 0 1 0 0 ]
    [ 1 1 1 0 0 0 ]
    [ 0 0 1 0 0 1 ]
    [ 1 1 1 1 1 0 ]
    [ 1 1 1 1 1 0 ]

Output:
    [ 1 1 1 1 1 ]
    [ 1 1 1 1 1 ]
</code></pre>

<p><em>Example 2:</em></p>

<pre><code>Input:
    [ 1 0 1 0 1 0 ]
    [ 0 1 0 1 0 1 ]
    [ 1 0 1 0 1 0 ]
    [ 0 1 0 1 0 1 ]

Output: 0
</code></pre>

<p><em>Example 3:</em></p>

<pre><code>Input:
    [ 0 0 0 1 1 1 ]
    [ 1 1 1 1 1 1 ]
    [ 0 0 1 0 0 1 ]
    [ 0 0 1 1 1 1 ]
    [ 0 0 1 1 1 1 ]

Output:
    [ 1 1 1 1 ]
    [ 1 1 1 1 ]
</code></pre>

<p>At first glance, this seemed to be a fairly easy task. It turned out to be much more complicated than I expected.</p>

<p>My initial idea was to scan the matrix from top left to bottom right, and, for any 1 found, to try to expand this position into a region toward the right and toward the bottom. When starting to think about the implementation, I found that this approach was going to be complicated, painful, and probably quite clumsy.</p>

<p>So, I decided to proceed in a different way: generate all rectangles toward the right and the bottom of any position with a 1, then eliminate those containing at least one zero, and find the largest remaining rectangle. In both the Raku and the Perl programs below, a rectangle consists of at least two contiguous 1s, and is uniquely defined by its top left and bottom right corners.</p>

<p>As both the Raku and the Perl programs described below are a bit complicated, I will avoid abusing the expressive power of the programming language ans will describe separately the main steps of the algorithm before providing the full program.</p>

<h3>Largest Rectangle in Raku</h3>

<p>For this program, we&#8217;ll use six matrices as test cases:</p>

<pre><code>my @matrices = 
    [ [ &lt;0 1 0 1&gt; ], [ &lt;0 0 1 0&gt; ], [ &lt;1 1 0 1&gt; ], [ &lt;1 1 0 1&gt; ] ], 
    [ [ &lt;1 1 0 1&gt; ], [ &lt;1 1 0 0&gt; ], [ &lt;0 1 1 1&gt; ], [ &lt;1 0 1 1&gt; ] ],
    [ [ &lt;0 1 0 1&gt; ], [ &lt;1 0 1 0&gt; ], [ &lt;0 1 0 0&gt; ], [ &lt;1 0 0 1&gt; ] ],

    [ [ &lt;1 1 0 1 1 1&gt; ], [ &lt;1 1 1 0 1 0&gt; ], 
        [ &lt;1 1 0 1 0 1&gt; ], [ &lt;1 1 1 0 0 1&gt; ] 
    ],

    [ [ &lt;0 0 0 1 0 0&gt; ], [ &lt;1 1 1 0 0 0&gt; ], 
      [ &lt;0 0 1 0 0 1&gt; ], [ &lt;1 1 1 1 1 0&gt; ], [ &lt;1 1 1 1 1 0&gt;],
    ],

    [ [ &lt;0 0 0 1 1 1&gt; ], [ &lt;1 1 1 1 1 1&gt; ], 
      [ &lt;0 0 1 0 0 1&gt; ], [ &lt;0 0 1 1 1 1&gt; ], 
      [ &lt;0 0 1 1 1 1&gt; ],
    ];
</code></pre>

<p>The first step will be to iterate over the six test cases and for each test matrix, to call the <code>print-matrix</code> subroutine (which pretty-prints the input matrix) and the <code>find-rect</code> subroutine, which does most of the work and will be described in greater detail below.</p>

<pre><code>for @matrices -&gt; @m {
    print-matrix @m;
    find-rect @m;
}
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>print-matrix</code> reads the input matrix line by line and prints a formated version of all such lines:</p>

<pre><code>sub print-matrix (@matrix) {
    say "[ $_ ]" for @matrix;
    say "";
}
</code></pre>

<p>For our first test matrix:</p>

<pre><code>[ [ &lt;0 1 0 1&gt; ], [ &lt;0 0 1 0&gt; ], [ &lt;1 1 0 1&gt; ], [ &lt;1 1 0 1&gt; ] ]
</code></pre>

<p>this subroutine prints this:</p>

<pre><code>[ 0 1 0 1 ]
[ 0 0 1 0 ]
[ 1 1 0 1 ]
[ 1 1 0 1 ]
</code></pre>

<p>As said before, the <code>find-rect</code> does the bulk of the work.</p>

<p>First, we make a <code>@positions</code> array of all positions (defined by their coordinates) in the matrix that contain a value equal to 1. For this, we use the <a href="https://docs.raku.org/routine/X">X</a> infix cross operator to generate a Cartesian product of all positions and filter out positions whose value in the matrix is not equal to 1:</p>

<pre><code>my $max-h = @m.end;
my $max-w = @m[0].end;
my @positions =  ((0..$max-h) X  (0..$max-w))
    .grep({@m[$_[0]][$_[1]] == 1});
</code></pre>

<p>For the first test matrix, the list of valid positions is this:</p>

<pre><code>[(0 1) (0 3) (1 2) (2 0) (2 1) (2 3) (3 0) (3 1) (3 3)]
</code></pre>

<p>The next step is to create a <code>@pairs</code> list of pairs of positions (which will represent the top left and bottom right corners of each rectangle). For this, we use the <a href="https://docs.raku.org/routine/combinations">combinations</a> built-in routine of Raku:</p>

<pre><code>    my @pairs = @positions.combinations: 2;
</code></pre>

<p>For our first test matrix, this generates a data structure like so (slightly reformatted for clarity):</p>

<pre><code>[((0 1) (0 3))  ((0 1) (1 2))  ((0 1) (2 0))  ((0 1) (2 1)) 
 ((0 1) (2 3))  ((0 1) (3 0))  ((0 1) (3 1))  ((0 1) (3 3)) 
 [content omitted for brevity]
 ((2 1) (3 1))  ((2 1) (3 3))  ((2 3) (3 0))  ((2 3) (3 1)) 
 ((2 3) (3 3))  ((3 0) (3 1))  ((3 0) (3 3))  ((3 1) (3 3))]
</code></pre>

<p>Note that, at this point, the rectangles represented by those point pairs may contain some 0s (we only know that the point pairs themselves are 1s). For example, the first point pair above:</p>

<pre><code>((0 1) (0 3))
</code></pre>

<p>corresponds to the following rectangle in the input matrix:</p>

<pre><code>1 0 1
</code></pre>

<p>As it can be seen, the bounds are 1s, but the middle item if 0. This is not a valid rectangle candidate. </p>

<p>In addition, the <code>((0 1) (3 0))</code> pair in the second line doesn&#8217;t define a valid rectangle because the second coordinate of the first pair (1) is larger than its counterpart in second pair, and we said that the first pair must represent the top left and the second pair the bottom right points of the rectangle. Here, the second point is to the left of the first. We need to eliminate these malformed rectangles.</p>

<p>The next step is therefore to keep only valid rectangles rectangles and store them into the <code>@eligible</code> array:</p>

<pre><code>my @eligible = gather {
    for @pairs -&gt; $p {
        # Remove malformed rectangles
        next if $p[0][0] &gt; $p[1][0] or $p[0][1] &gt; $p[1][1];
        # remove rectangles containing 0s.
        next if @m[$p[0][0]..$p[1][0];$p[0][1]..$p[1][1]].any == 0; 
        take $p;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Note that the following expression (using a semi-colon to separate the coordinate ranges) :
    @m[$p[0][0]..$p[1][0];$p[0][1]..$p[1][1]]</p>

<p>flattens the input rectangle into a flat list, so that we can use a simple <code>any</code> <a href="https://docs.raku.org/type/Junction">junction</a> to detect any 0 item.</p>

<p>If the <code>@eligible</code> array is empty, then we did not find any suitable rectangle. In such a case, we print 0 and exit the subroutine.</p>

<pre><code>say "0\n" and return unless @eligible;
</code></pre>

<p>In the case of our first test matrix, there are six eligible rectangles:</p>

<pre><code>[((2 0) (2 1))  ((2 0) (3 0))  ((2 0) (3 1))  
 ((2 1) (3 1))  ((2 3) (3 3))  ((3 0) (3 1))
]
</code></pre>

<p>We now need to pick the largest rectangle. For this, we simply sort in descending order according to their area size. In Raku, when the code object passed as the first parameter to the <code>sort</code> subroutine takes only one parameter, then it is not a comparison code block, but a code object implementing the transformation to be applied to all items before applying the default <code>cmp</code>comparison subroutine. Here, we use this code block:</p>

<pre><code>{($_[1][0] - $_[0][0] + 1) * ($_[1][1] - $_[0][1] + 1)}
</code></pre>

<p>in order to compute the area of the rectangle and use it for the comparison. So the sort block looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>my $rect = (reverse sort { 
        ($_[1][0] - $_[0][0] + 1) * ($_[1][1] - $_[0][1] + 1) 
        }, @eligible)[0];
</code></pre>

<p>Now, we&#8217;re done, we have the largest rectangle, we only need to display the result.</p>

<p>This is the full code of the program:</p>

<pre><code>use v6;

<h3>Largest Rectangle in Perl</h3>

<p>For this program, we&#8217;ll use seven matrices for our test cases:</p>

<pre><code>my @matrices = 
    ( [ [ qw &lt;0 1 0 1&gt; ], [ qw &lt;0 0 1 0&gt; ], 
        [ qw &lt;1 1 0 1&gt; ], [ qw &lt;1 1 0 1&gt; ] 
      ], 

      [ [ qw &lt;1 1 0 1&gt; ], [ qw &lt;1 1 0 0&gt; ], 
        [ qw &lt;0 1 1 1&gt; ], [ qw &lt;1 0 1 1&gt; ] 
      ],

      [ [ qw &lt;0 1 0 1&gt; ], [ qw &lt;1 0 1 0&gt; ], 
        [ qw &lt;0 1 0 0&gt; ], [ qw &lt;1 0 0 1&gt; ] 
      ],

      [ [ qw &lt;1 1 0 1 1 1&gt; ], [ qw &lt;1 1 1 0 1 0&gt; ], 
          [ qw &lt;1 1 0 1 0 1&gt; ], [ qw &lt;1 1 1 0 0 1&gt; ] 
      ],

      [ [ qw &lt;0 0 0 1 0 0&gt; ], [ qw &lt;1 1 1 0 0 0&gt; ], 
          [ qw &lt;0 0 1 0 0 1&gt; ], [ qw &lt;1 1 1 1 1 0&gt; ], 
          [ qw &lt;1 1 1 1 1 0&gt;],
      ],
      [ [ qw &lt;1 0 1 0 1 0&gt; ], [ qw &lt;0 1 0 1 0 1&gt; ], 
          [ qw &lt;1 0 1 0 1 0&gt; ], [ qw &lt;0 1 0 1 0 1&gt; ],
      ],
      [ [ qw &lt;0 0 0 1 1 1&gt; ], [ qw &lt;1 1 1 1 1 1&gt; ], 
          [ qw &lt;0 0 1 0 0 1&gt; ], [ qw &lt;0 0 1 1 1 1&gt; ], 
          [ qw &lt;0 0 1 1 1 1&gt; ],
      ],
    );
</code></pre>

<p>The first step will be to iterate over the seven test cases and for each test matrix, to call the <code>print_matrix</code> subroutine (which pretty-prints the input matrix) and the <code>find_rect</code> subroutine, which does most of the work and will be described in detail below.</p>

<pre><code>for my $m_ref (@matrices) {
    print_matrix($m_ref);
    find_rect($m_ref);
}

sub print_matrix {
    my @matrix = @{$_[0]};
    say "";
    say "[ @$_ ]" for @matrix;
    say "";
}
</code></pre>

<p>For our first sample matrix:</p>

<pre><code>             [ [ qw &lt;0 1 0 1&gt; ], [ qw &lt;0 0 1 0&gt; ], 
               [ qw &lt;1 1 0 1&gt; ], [ qw &lt;1 1 0 1&gt; ] 
             ],
</code></pre>

<p>the <code>print_matrix</code> subroutine displays this:</p>

<pre><code>[ 0 1 0 1 ]
[ 0 0 1 0 ]
[ 1 1 0 1 ]
[ 1 1 0 1 ]
</code></pre>

<p>As said before, the <code>find-rect</code> does the bulk of the work.</p>

<p>First, we make a <code>@positions</code> array of all positions (defined by their coordinates) in the matrix that contain a value equal to 1. For this, we use a nested <code>for</code> loop:</p>

<pre><code>my @positions;
for my $i (0..$#m) {
    for my $j (0..$#{$m[0]}) {
        push @positions, [$i, $j] unless $m[$i][$j] == 0;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>For the first test matrix, we obtain the following non-zero positions:</p>

<pre><code>(0 1) (0 3) (1 2) (2 0) (2 1) (2 3) (3 0) (3 1) (3 3)
</code></pre>

<p>Then we use another nested <code>for</code> loop to find all the point pairs:</p>

<pre><code>my @pairs;
for my $k (0..$#positions) {
    for my $n ($k+1..$#positions) {
        push @pairs, [ [@{$positions[$k]}], [@{$positions[$n]}] ];
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Note that, at this point, the rectangles represented by those point pairs may contain some 0s (we only know that the point pairs themselves are 1s). For example, the first point pair generated:</p>

<pre><code>((0 1) (0 3))
</code></pre>

<p>corresponds to the following rectangle in the matrix:</p>

<pre><code>1 0 1
</code></pre>

<p>As it can be seen, the bounds are 1s, but the middle item is 0. This is not a valid rectangle candidate. </p>

<p>In addition, we obtain pairs such as <code>((0 1) (3 0))</code> , which doesn&#8217;t define a valid rectangle because the second coordinate of the first pair (1) is larger than its counterpart in second pair, and we said earlier that the first pair must represent the top left point and the second pair the bottom right point of the rectangle. Here, the second point is to the left of the first. We need to eliminate these malformed rectangles.</p>

<p>The code below eliminates invalid rectangles and stores the others in the <code>@eligible</code> array:</p>

<pre><code>my @eligible;
for my $p_ref (@pairs) {
    my @p = @$p_ref;
    # Remove malformed rectangles
    next if $p[0][0] &gt; $p[1][0] or $p[0][1] &gt; $p[1][1];
    # Remove rectangles containing 0s
    my $only_ones = 1;
    for my $i ($p[0][0].. $p[1][0]) {
        for my $j ($p[0][1]..$p[1][1]) {
            if ($m[$i][$j] == 0) {
                $only_ones = 0;
                next;
            }
        }
    }
     push @eligible, $p_ref if $only_ones;
}
</code></pre>

<p>If the <code>@eligible</code> array is empty, then we did not find any suitable rectangle. So, we print out 0 and exit the subroutine.</p>

<pre><code>say "0\n" and return unless @eligible;
</code></pre>

<p>In the case of our first test matrix, there are six eligible rectangles left:</p>

<pre><code>((2 0) (2 1))  ((2 0) (3 0))  ((2 0) (3 1))  ((2 1) (3 1))  ((2 3) (3 3))  ((3 0) (3 1))
</code></pre>

<p>We now need to find the largest rectangle. For this, we sort the eligible rectangles in descending order according to their area size and pick the first one in the sorted list. Since the comparison routine computing the rectangle area is somewhat complicated, we use a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schwartzian_transform">Schwartzian Transform</a> for the sort:</p>

<pre><code>my @sorted = map { $_-&gt;[0] } 
             sort { $b-&gt;[1] &lt;=&gt; $a-&gt;[1] }
             map { [$_, ($_-&gt;[1][0] - $_-&gt;[0][0] + 1) 
                   * ($_-&gt;[1][1] - $_-&gt;[0][1] + 1)] } 
                   @eligible;
my $rect = $sorted[0];
</code></pre>

<p>Now that we have found the largest rectangle, we only need to display the result.</p>

<p>This is the full code of the program:</p>

<pre><code>use strict;

<p>You are given an unsorted array of integers <code>@N</code>.</p>

<p>Write a script to find the longest consecutive sequence.</p>

  My solution
</h2>

<p>Print 0 if none sequence found<br>
This was relatively straight forward. Once I checked that we have one or more integer values, I then loop through a sorted list of numbers.</p>

<p>I have an array <code>@current</code> that stores the current run. This gets reset if the last number is not one less than the current number. I then set <code>@largest</code> to store the largest sequence of integers.</p>

<p>If <code>@largest</code> contains at least two numbers I print that array, otherwise I print zero.</p>

<p>On a programming note, I know that I can use <code>if (@a &lt; @b) {</code>, but I still prefer to use <code>if (scalar(@a) &lt; scalar(@b) {</code>. That way it is pretty clear want I meant, rather than Perl novices needed to know Perl will return the size of an array in a scalar context.</p>

<p>This is similar to the '<a href="https://perlweeklychallenge.org/blog/perl-weekly-challenge-084/#TASK2">Find Square</a>' task of challenge 084.</p>

<p>I probably over comment my code in PWC tasks. Mainly as it helps others follow my logic. So using nothing other the comment lines, here's how I solved this task:<br>
</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>    # Process the input
    # Sanity check
    # Go through each rows and column
    # The top left of a square cannot be on the right or bottom row (hence -2)

            # Find the maximum rectangle size
                # No more rectangles can be made from this starting point

     <p>TPF Board members and the community leaders meet every month and here are the minutes from the October 2020 meeting.</p>

<h2>Part 1 - Community</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Attendees</p>

<ul>
<li>Board: Stuart Mackintosh, Peter Krawczyk, Dan Wright, Dave Rolsky, Ricardo Signes, Makoto Nozaki (late) </li>
<li>Leaders: Jason Crome, Samantha McVey, Alex Beamish, Sawyer X, Todd Rinaldo, Matthias Bloch</li>
<li>Admin: Nic Evans</li>
<li>Confirmed absence: Mark Keating, Curtis Poe</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Grants</p>

<ul>
<li>One grant approved - needs funding as there's no budget</li>
<li>Another grant was approved earlier but no work started 
<ul>
<li>Should have been canceled / resubmitted already according to the charter</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Working with Nic on website updates - close to completion</li>
<li>Main issue - no working budget
<ul>
<li>Possibly review previous budgets and consider how this can be increased per year</li>
<li>Funds are sectioned to languages (GC, Perl and Raku)</li>
<li>Pete looking to rearrange fund 'pots' to enable easier tracking next year</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Discussion around grants funding for funds - Can/should there be different pots? Can sponsors request specific support for each language - this needs further discussion - Jason Crome to follow up</li>
<li>Grant suggestions from the committee are available on the web</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Marketing</p>

<ul>
<li>Brief survey carried out regarding brand of The Perl Foundation</li>
<li>Highlighted need for wider survey, putting together budget proposal</li>
<li>Filled in creative brief for TPF</li>
<li>Promotion of TPF via Google Ads - discussion going on</li>
<li>z/OS article was mentioned as a good addition to marketing</li>
<li>Website improvements, bugs/issues list created</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>The Perl/Raku Conference (USA)</p>

<ul>
<li>The contract of 2020/2021 is active</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>EU Conference</p>

<ul>
<li>Discussion points: Organizers and sponsorship</li>
<li>Organizers
<ul>
<li>Andrew mentioned possibility of Perl/Raku conference</li>
<li>Should we talking about making EU conference a TPF event?</li>
<li>There is currently no immediate visible interest in having funding of an EU conference in Europe taken over by TPF</li>
<li>Historically YEF was formed because TPF didn't have the people to do this. Also EPO was formed</li>
<li>We need to talk to the key people to organize an event in Europe</li>
<li>The nature of conferences may be different going forward, we don't know when they will return to how they used to be. We need to look at our future - do we want more virtual conferences? Are there other opportunities for physical?</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Sponsorship</p>

<ul>
<li>Costs might be lower for virtual - how easy to get sponsors for virtual versus physical conferences?</li>
<li><p>We need to be clear with sponsors if we have both a US and an EU conference</p></li>
<li><p>Opinions:</p>

<ul>
<li>We have obligations to control how money is spent. There must be set guidelines. Whenever we create a special bucket for sponsorship we have an obligation to spend money on that bucket. We cannot then spend it on something else. What if we collect funds for a conference and it doesn't happen? We would have to give the money back. Currently we ask sponsors to give money to TPF (general funds) for this reason.</li>
<li>I want to make sure when I talk to sponsors to steer away from where money is going to 'this is TPF and we have various things we want to spend money on'. We need to avoid earmarked funds . Do not encourage sponsorship for specific items such as a conference.</li>
<li>I see this as more of an opportunity to get more money especially when the conference is held in a city where a major sponsor is located - need to find a way around legal issues - otherwise a missed opportunity</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Could have a soft earmarking with disclaimer such as 'should event not happen, it will be moved to general funds.'</li>
</ul></li>
<li>To continue discussion at next meeting</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Raku</p>

<ul>
<li>The Raku steering council formed recently, elected by core developers.</li>
<li>Question: How does CAT relate to Raku community?</li>
<li>Stuart: joint decision taken to keep Raku with TPF for now - longer term vision keen to progress recognised resources. These must adhere to set of recognised quality standards. CAT was established to do this, so should also provide support to Raku communities. Although sounds like marketing, it is a governance function. So we should support Raku Steering Council in any conduct issues. We need a recognised Raku presence within the organisation. </li>
<li>Action: invite member of Raku community to attend the Community leaders meeting - let them know TPF will support Raku community</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Perl</p>

<ul>
<li>Governance work to try and over time figure out a proper governance structure that is understood, accepted and supported by the community. </li>
<li>Stuart: this is about creating a process that will help the technical ecosystem for a long time. If it takes a long time, it needs to be done right/as best it can be - follow up again next month</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Infrastructure</p>

<ul>
<li>Trying to get a coherent list of what needs to be done</li>
<li>Discussion on getting perl web infrastructure managed under same system</li>
<li>All the essential password are documented</li>
<li>We need to look at Github tracker and see that issues are closed</li>
<li>Feedback at moment is positive - need to promote the committee exists when it is in a good position.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

A Continuous Integration system (aka CI) can shorten the feedback cycle for your code.
It will usually run all your tests immediately after you push the code to your cloud-based Git host.

You can run your code on various Operating Systems and multiple versions of Perl.

Earlier we saw how to create <a href="/github-actions-running-on-3-operating-systems">GitHub Actions to run on Linux, Windows, and Mac OSX</a>.
I used that idea on an old module of I maintain that is uses <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Module::Install">Module::Install</a> for packaging.
<p>
At first it failed due to missing Module::Install, and even though I had a guess of the source of the problem, I thought it would be a good
opportunity to check how could I see the content of the cpanm log files after a failing installation.

<p>This is a fairly silly use of the <em>constraint programming</em> approach I used <a href="http://www.rabbitfarm.com/cgi-bin/blosxom/perl/2020/11/08">last week</a>. Like last time I generate all combinations and test them using a filtering approach. The filter is an array of constraint functions. Here we just have two simple constraints though!</p>

<p>I didn’t have a chance to implement a solution in Perl. I would have used a similar constraint approach if I did. This is a natural use for Prolog and if you’re interested in reading in my Prolog implementation you can go <a href="http://www.rabbitfarm.com/cgi-bin/blosxom/prolog/2020/11/15">here</a>.</p>       </div><!-- card-text -->     </div>

<p><br />
</p>

<p>Interpreters read and execute scripts (whereas shells are more like a kitchen pass-through and can either execute or hand over to another interpreter). When we specify interpreter on the command line, it is the one that will be used. For instance <code>Rscript script.R</code> will execute <em>script.R</em> using the <code>Rscript</code> interpreter.</p>

<p>When we execute a file without explicitly giving an interpreter (for instance, like <code>./myscript.pl</code>), it is the job of the &ldquo;shebang&rdquo; to tell to the shell/OS which interpreter to use. The shebang is that first line of a text file that starts with <code>#!</code> and is followed by the interpreter path:</p>

<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/perl
</code></pre>

<p>Sometimes we see the <code>env</code> program, which finds the the first <code>perl</code> in our path:</p>

<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env perl
</code></pre>

<p><code>env</code> does not split args therefore we can&rsquo;t add options:</p>

<p><code>#!/usr/bin/env perl -w</code></p>

<p>And, <code>env</code> is not always located in <code>/usr/bin/env</code> so it can guarantee some portability at machine/distribution level but not always between distributions.</p>

<h2 id="perl-is-nice">Perl is nice</h2>

<p>The <code>perl</code> is not like other interpreters—its nice, even with challenges. <code>perl</code> inspects the shebang to check if it&rsquo;s really for it (and if not it hands our program over to another interpreter).</p>

<p>For instance the file <em>i-am-python.pl</em> contains a Python program, which is definitely not Perl:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="color:#75715e">#!/usr/bin/python</span>
<span style="color:#f92672">import</span> os
<span style="color:#f92672">import</span> time

<span style="color:#66d9ef">print</span>(<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;I&#39;m a snake : &#34;</span> <span style="color:#f92672">+</span> os<span style="color:#f92672">.</span>environ[<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;SHELL&#34;</span>] <span style="color:#f92672">+</span> <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34; &#34;</span> <span style="color:#f92672">+</span> os<span style="color:#f92672">.</span>environ[<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;_&#34;</span>])

<span style="color:#75715e"># Keep it alive to have time to inspect with ps</span>
<span style="color:#66d9ef">while</span> True:
    time<span style="color:#f92672">.</span>sleep(<span style="color:#ae81ff">5</span>)</code></pre></div>
<p>Obviously we don&rsquo;t care about the extension as it does not mean any kind of file association (although some systems let you associate it). So we have a <em>.pl</em> file and we execute it with <code>perl</code> but inside we have a <code>python</code> shebang and some python code. It&rsquo;s clearly not a valid Perl file.</p>

<p>If you don&rsquo;t believe me, check this with a quick syntax check <code>perl -c i-am-python.pl</code> that tells us it isn&rsquo;t valid Perl:</p>

<pre><code>$ perl -c i-am-python.pl
syntax error at i-am-python.pl line 3, near &quot;import time&quot;
i-am-python.pl had compilation errors.
</code></pre>

<p>When we execute this file with perl, surprisingly, everything goes fine. How did that happen? <code>perl</code> is smart enough to give the script to <code>python</code>!</p>

<pre><code>$ perl i-am-python.pl
I'm a snake : /bin/bash /usr/bin/perl
</code></pre>

<p>And if we want to check which interpreter really runs this script, we can look in the process table:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">$ ps aux | grep <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;i-am-pytho[n].pl&#34;</span>
tduponc+  <span style="color:#ae81ff">5647</span>  <span style="color:#ae81ff">0</span>.0  <span style="color:#ae81ff">0</span>.0  <span style="color:#ae81ff">33208</span>  <span style="color:#ae81ff">7024</span> pts/0    S    <span style="color:#ae81ff">13</span>:04   <span style="color:#ae81ff">0</span>:00 /usr/bin/python i-am-python.pl</code></pre></div>
<p>Note that <code>i-am-pytho[n].pl</code> with the brackets, which puts the <code>n</code> in a character class. That&rsquo;s a nifty trick so <code>grep</code> finds the line with <code>python</code> but not the <code>grep</code> process itself because that pattern won&rsquo;t match a literal <code>[</code>.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t forget to kill the program since it&rsquo;s sleeping forever!</p>

<p>Now, what if we want to test the converse and run Perl code with a <code>python</code> interpreter?</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-perl" data-lang="perl"><span style="color:#75715e">#!/usr/bin/perl</span>

<span style="color:#66d9ef">my</span> $str <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;I&#39;m a jewel&#34;</span>;
<span style="color:#66d9ef">print</span> <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;$str : $ENV{SHELL} $ENV{_}\n&#34;</span>;

<span style="color:#66d9ef">while</span> (<span style="color:#ae81ff">1</span>) { sleep <span style="color:#ae81ff">5</span>; }</code></pre></div>
<p>This is a valid Perl file but the <code>python</code> interpreter does not hand over to <code>perl</code> and just returns a Python error:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">$ python i-am-perl.py

       ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax</code></pre></div>
<p>This is special to Python. Try it yourself with bash, Ruby, or something else.</p>

<h2 id="i-have-something-for-you">I have something for you</h2>

<p>Having the correct interpreter on the command line does not mean that the shebang is totally ignored. <code>perl</code> is once again super smart and behaves exactly as we can imagine (DWIM). For instance, what if we put a warning switch (<code>-w</code>) in the shebang, like in this file <em>override-bang.pl</em>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-perl" data-lang="perl"><span style="color:#75715e">#!/usr/bin/perl -w</span>

$str <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;will produce a warning&#34;</span>;</code></pre></div>
<p>Even though we don&rsquo;t put the <code>-w</code> on the command line, we still get warnings:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">$ perl override-bang.pl
Name <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;main::str&#34;</span> used only once: possible typo at override-bang.pl line <span style="color:#ae81ff">3</span>.</code></pre></div>
<h2 id="plenty-is-no-plague">Plenty is no plague</h2>

<p>Now, what if we specify some switches on the command line and some others in the shebang? <strong>SPOILER</strong>: they are simply merged together.</p>

<p>When we run <code>perl -c overridebang.pl</code> to check a syntactically-valid file, we get the switches from the command line and the shebang line. We get a <code>perl -cw</code> execution:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">Name <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;main::str&#34;</span> used only once: possible typo at override-bang.pl line <span style="color:#ae81ff">5</span>.
override-bang.pl syntax OK</code></pre></div>
<p>What if we have conflicting options like <code>-w</code> to enable warnings and <code>-X</code> to disable them? Here&rsquo;s <em>enable-warnings.pl</em>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-perl" data-lang="perl"><span style="color:#75715e">#!/usr/bin/perl -w</span>

$str <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;will produce a warning&#34;</span>;</code></pre></div>
<p>When we run this on its own, we get a warning as expected:</p>

<pre><code>$ perl enable-warnings.pl
Name &quot;main::str&quot; used only once: possible typo at warnings.pl line 3.
</code></pre>

<p>When we add <code>-X</code> on the command line, there is no output:</p>

<pre><code>$ perl -X enable-warnings.pl
</code></pre>

<p>How about the other way around with <code>-X</code> on the shebang? Here&rsquo;s <em>disable-warnings.pl</em>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-perl" data-lang="perl"><span style="color:#75715e">#!/usr/bin/perl -X</span>

$str <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;will produce a warning&#34;</span>;</code></pre></div>
<p>When we run this with <code>-w</code>, we still don&rsquo;t get output:</p>

<pre><code>$ perl -X enable-warnings.pl
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>-X</code> always turns off warnings.</p>

<p>The shebang (<code>-X</code>) is taken in priority versus the command line and no warning is reported. It&rsquo;s the same if we execute the file with <code>perl -W disable-warnings.pl</code>.</p>

<p>We could imagine that&rsquo;s a rule to resolve conflicts with &ldquo;last seen&rdquo; parameter but wait, it&rsquo;s not that simple.</p>

<p>How about <code>-X</code> versus <code>-W</code>, which enables all warnings? Who wins then? It turns out that the last on defined wins. We can see that right on the command line:</p>

<pre><code>$ perl -W -X -e '$str = &quot;will produce a warning&quot;'
$ perl -X -W -e '$str = &quot;will produce a warning&quot;'
Name &quot;main::str&quot; used only once: possible typo at -e line 1.
</code></pre>

<p>As an exercise for the reader, try the different combinations of taint checking options: <code>-T</code> and <code>-U</code>.</p>

<h2 id="a-magic-incantation">A magic incantation</h2>

<p>Sometimes we see some odd lines at the beginning of Perl programs. What the hell is this black magic? This is actually very smart opening is &ldquo;polyglot&rdquo; and correct for both shells (with or without shebang support) and <code>perl</code>:</p>

<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/perl
eval 'exec /usr/bin/perl -S $0 ${1+&quot;$@&quot;}'
    if $running_under_some_shell;
</code></pre>

<p>If we start the script with <code>perl</code>, the job is done and <code>perl</code> executes:</p>

<pre><code>eval 'exec /usr/bin/perl -S $0 ${1+&quot;$@&quot;}'
if $running_under_some_shell;
</code></pre>

<p>That <code>$running_under_some_shell</code> has no value, so the code translate to a false conditional. This line is ignored and the rest of the file is interpreted normally.:</p>

<pre><code>eval 'exec /usr/bin/perl -S $0 ${1+&quot;$@&quot;} if 0;'
</code></pre>

<p>What if we start the script with a shell that recognizes the shebang? The shell does the handover to <code>perl</code>, which then reads the first line (shebang then <code>eval ...</code>). The execution flow is then the same than above (magic incantation does nothing and file is interpreted). Nothing surprising there.</p>

<p>But what if we started the script with a shell that does not recognize the shebang so no handover occurs right away? This is actually where this magic is useful. The shell will ignore first line and will never reach third line. Why will it never reach third line? A newline terminates the shell command and <code>exec</code> will replace the current execution by <code>perl</code>. The rest of the script doesn&rsquo;t matter after that <code>exec</code>. Our code changes from this:</p>

<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/perl
eval 'exec /usr/bin/perl -S $0 ${1+&quot;$@&quot;}'
    if $running_under_some_shell;
</code></pre>

<p>to effectively this:</p>

<pre><code>eval 'exec /usr/bin/perl -S $0 ${1+&quot;$@&quot;}'
</code></pre>

<p>Those <code>$0</code> and <code>$@</code> are shell words for the script name and arguments
and the <code>-S</code> tells <code>perl</code> look for the value in <code>$0</code> using PATH environment variable. (<a href="https://perldoc.perl.org/perlrun.html#Command-Switches">perldoc</a>)</p>

<h2 id="x-is-fun">-x is fun</h2>

<p>We&rsquo;ve had fun with the <code>perl</code> interpreter and the shebang, but <code>perl</code> has a <code>-x</code> which is already fun by design. This option tells Perl that the program to execute is actually embedded in a larger chunk of unrelated text to ignore. Perhaps the Perl program is in the middle of an email message:</p>

<pre><code>&quot;I do not know if it is what you want, but it is what you get.
        -- Larry Wall&quot;

#!/usr/bin/env perl

print &quot;perl -x ignores everything before shebang\n&quot;;
print &lt;DATA&gt;;

__END__

&quot;Fortunately, it is easier to keep an old interpreter around than an
old computer.
        -- Larry Wall&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>Executing this as a program is a syntax error because the Larry Wall quote before the shebang is not valid Perl. When we execute this code with <code>perl -x</code>, everything before the shebang is ignored and it works:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">$ perl -x email.txt
perl -x ignores everything before shebang

<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;Fortunately, it is easier to keep an old interpreter around than an
</span><span style="color:#e6db74">old computer.
</span><span style="color:#e6db74">        -- Larry Wall&#34;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Out of curiosity, what if we tried to go one step further? How about multiple shebangs in a file, where one of them has a <code>-x</code>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-perl" data-lang="perl"><span style="color:#75715e">#!/usr/bin/perl -x</span>
<span style="color:#75715e">#!/usr/bin/perl</span></code></pre></div>
<p>But it only produces an error:</p>

<pre><code>Can't emulate -x on #! line.
</code></pre>

<p>There is however a trick to achieve this, by using shell <code>eval</code>. That <code>perl -x</code> is now executed in a shell process and not interpreted by perl binary like previously.:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-perl" data-lang="perl"><span style="color:#75715e">#!/bin/sh</span>

<span style="color:#75715e">#!perl</span>
<span style="color:#66d9ef">print</span> <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;$]\n&#34;</span>;</code></pre></div>
<h2 id="startperl">startperl</h2>

<p>This article would not be complete without discussing a bit about the config variable <code>$Config{startperl}</code>. This variable comes from <em>Config.pm</em>  that provides information about configuration environment (which you also see with <code>perl -V</code>):</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">$ perl -e <span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;use Config; print $Config{startperl}&#39;</span>
<span style="color:#75715e">#!/usr/bin/perl</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This is actually built during compilation from defaults or user/vendor provided configs. What if we want a different value? Simply specify the value of this during the <code>./Configure</code> step, the configure option is <code>-Dstartperl='...'</code>. We then need to rebuild <code>perl</code>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">$ ./Configure -des -Dstartperl<span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;#!/my/shebang&#39;</span>
$ make test install</code></pre></div>
<p>Now our custom value is the default:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">$ perl -e <span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;use Config; print $Config{startperl}&#39;</span>
<span style="color:#75715e">#!/my/shebang</span></code></pre></div>
<p><a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/ExtUtils::MakeMaker
">ExtUtils::MakeMaker</a> and <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Module::Build
">Module::Build</a> seems also to use <code>startperl</code> among other methods to fix modules shebangs.</p>

<p>Take care to use an interpreter or a program that behaves like a <code>perl</code> interpreter! Some CPAN modules use <code>startperl</code> to write first line of generated perl tests. The <code>/usr/bin/env</code> limitation still apply here.</p>

<p>I decided to try a <em>constraint programming</em> approach for this. While there are several modules for doing this available on CPAN I didn’t want to quite go so deep down that rabbithole. Instead I took the simpler path of implementing each constraint as a subroutine stored in an array. For each candidate combination the constraints are tests. Since all constraints must be satisfied if any one returns a false value then we can move immediately to the next combination.</p>

<p>I was tempted to repeat roughly the same design as Part 1 and use constraints but that really would be over engineering it! Instead here we just loop over all possible values <code>$a</code> and test using logarithms to see if <code>$b</code> holds an integer value. There seems to be a number of ways to do the test to determine if a scalar holds an integer but a regex seems maybe the most idiomatically Perlish way.</p>       </div><!-- card-text -->     </div>
