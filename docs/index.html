<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>Once upon a time, 
a guy named Larry Wall 
created a language called Perl.

He became the BDFL 
of this PL 
which values are TIMTOWTDI, 
DWIM, 
POLA 
and as all UNIXes: 
KISS 
and DOTADIW.

Perl enhances some key concepts 
of AWK, 
SED 
or GREP 
and even provides ACK 
and leads industry standard REGEX 
(PCRE).

PPL started to ‚ù§Ô∏è Perl, 
meeting in PM groups 
and calling themself JAPH.

Eventually, big-sized meetings appeared 
like YAPC, 
TPC 
and TPRCIC 
(or chartreuse-sized ones like PTS).

There were also associations 
like TPF 
or EPO 
and individuals 
like YOU 
and ME.

FYI in 2021, 
I decided to organize TEM 
because hey, YOLO!

Technically speaking, 
you can say Perl 
or perl 
but not PERL 
nor the horrific PEARL... üò±

And if you don't know, 
go on IRC 
and ask PURL! ü§ñ 

People say 
"Only perl can parse Perl" 
but there is PPI, 
PPR 
and PLS.

Interfacing w/ native extensions is easy 
with FFI, 
XS, 
SWIG 
or WASM 
(and even easier with NCI in Raku).

Perl lovers contribute 
to the CPAN w/ ‚ù§Ô∏è  
via PAUSE 
so Perl users can use CPANP, 
CPANM 
or CPM 
to DRY.

You can browse MetaCPAN 
for DBI, 
EUMM, 
MB, 
LWP 
or PDL 
or even some idiot ACME.

Each DIST 
contains a whole lot of DOC 
in a format named POD 
and even a dedicated RT Q.

If you're in trouble, 
have a look at HOP 
or PBP.

IMHO 
it is a good PPT, 
but maybe a bit WTF... 
IDK ü§∑
THX for attending 
and FWIW 
here is a well deserved GIF.

TY

<p>Additionally I have:</p>

<ul>
<li>Ported the change log from text to Markdown</li>
<li>Added some of the <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Perl::Critic::Policy::Documentation::RequirePodSections">suggested sections</a> to the documentation, some of these will have to be updated with more information</li>
<li>I have added some more references and documentation and there is more to come in this space</li>
<li>I have bumped the Perl requirement from 5.6 to 5.8 since the test suite uses UTF-8, <code>perlver</code> is indeed a <em>nifty</em> tool, you can use it to <a href="http://jonasbn.github.io/til/perl/find_out_what_your_perl_minimum_version_requirement_is.html">find out what your perl minimum version requirement is</a>
</li>
<li>Finally I have documented that the distribution is not compatible with OpenSSL 3.X.X only 1.X.X</li>
</ul>

<p>This concludes this feature release. The next major thing is to make the distrubution compatible with OpenSSL 3.X.X - so there are <a href="https://www.openssl.org/docs/man3.0/man7/migration_guide.html">plenty of things to do</a>.</p>

<p>Thanks to James Rouzier (@jrouzierinverse) for his <code>create_as_string</code> feature - your contribution is most welcome</p>

  Now with Python
</h2>

<p>Before I get stuck into my solutions for this task, I have some news. I've used Perl for over 20 years, and think I'm pretty good at it. However, Python is something relatively new for me. I've only really used it for the past five years, and I'm using it more and more at work these days. So from this week forward, I'll do at least one solution in Python. On with that, here's this weeks blog.</p>

<h2>
  <a href="#task-1-jortsort">
  </a>
  TASK #1 ‚Ä∫ JortSort
</h2>

<h3>
  <a href="#task">
  </a>
  Task
</h3>

<p>You are given a list of numbers.</p>

<p>Write a script to implement JortSort. It should return true/false depending if the given list of numbers are already sorted.</p>

<h3>
  <a href="#my-solutions">
  </a>
  My solutions
</h3>

<p>This is relatively straight forward and my solutions in both languages follow the same logic.</p>

<ul>
<li>Assume the numbers are sorted</li>
<li>Iterate through the array (Perl) / list (Python) from the second element to the last. If that value is smaller than the previous one, we know it is not sorted, and can exit the iterations early.</li>
<li>Display <code>0</code> or <code>1</code> (representing false or true)</li>
</ul>

<p>The main difference between the Perl and Python code is that Python doesn't automatically convert strings to numbers, so that has to be done manually.</p>

  Task
</h3>

<p>Write a script to generate first 5 Long Primes. A prime number (p) is called Long Prime if (1/p) has an infinite decimal expansion repeating every (p-1) digits.</p>

<h3>
  <a href="#my-solution">

  My solution
</h3>

<p>Like with the first solution, my solutions this task follow the same methodology for both languages. I start from three and keep counting until I find five numbers that (a) are primes and (b) has an infinite decimal expansion repeating every n-1 digits.</p>

<p>To determine if a number is a prime, I have a function that counts from 2 to the square root of the number. If the number is divisible by that value without a remainder, I return false. If the loop ends, then I return true.</p>

<p>To determine the second conditional, we can be use the logic of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repeating_decimal">repeating decimals</a> formula to calculate the number of digits required to repeat the sequence. This was also used in the second task of <a href="https://dev.to/simongreennet/weekly-challenge-106-1cn7">challenge 106</a>.</p>

<p>Unlike that time, we aren't really interested in the actual digits. For this this task, I take the value of <code>(10 * remainder) mod number</code> and keep looping until we hit the same remainder.</p>

<p>Then it's a matter of printing the list. For Perl that is <code>say join ', ', @solutions</code> while Python is <code>print(*solutions, sep=', ')</code>.</p>

        <p>The <code>deprecated</code> warning is a grab-bag. Basically, anything that is deprecated causes this warning to be generated, and the list changes from release to release.</p>

<p>The only reason I can think of <strong>ever</strong> to turn this off is around a deprecated construction while you are actively working to eliminate it. Silencing it and then forgetting about it <strong>will</strong> bite you, eventually.</p>

<p>For the curious (and to run my word count, since otherwise this would be a <strong>really</strong> short blog entry), the current list of deprecations according to the 5.34.0 <a href="http://perldoc.perl.org/5.34.0/perldiag.html">perldiag</a> is:</p>

<dl>
    <dt>do "%s" failed, '.' is no longer in @INC; did you mean do "./%s"?</dt>
    <dd><code>.</code> (the current directory) was removed from <code>@INC</code> in Perl 5.26.</dd>

<p>    <dt>Use of "goto" to jump into a construct is deprecated</dt><br />
    <dd>This has been deprecated since Perl 5.12. No word that I know of on when it will actually be removed.</dd></p>

<p>    <dt>Use of '%s' in \p{} or \P{} is deprecated because: %s</dt><br />
    <dd>This is emitted for deprecated Unicode properties. The only timetable on these is that they will be removed from Perl when the Unicode Consortium removes them from Unicode. Be warned.</dd></p>

<p>    <dt>Use of tainted arguments in %s is deprecated</dt><br />
    <dd>This message is issued by <code>system()</code> and <code>exec()</code> when you feed them tainted arguments. No word that I know of on when this will become fatal, but I am surprised it is not already.</dd></p>

        <p>These are some answers to the Week 139 of the <a href="https://perlweeklychallenge.org/blog/perl-weekly-challenge-139/">Perl Weekly Challenge</a> organized by <a href="http://blogs.perl.org/users/mohammad_s_anwar/">Mohammad S. Anwar</a>.</p>

<p><em>Spoiler Alert:</em> This weekly challenge deadline is due in a few days from now (on November 21, 2021 at 24:00). This blog post offers some solutions to this challenge, please don‚Äôt read on if you intend to complete the challenge on your own.</p>

<h2>Task 1: JostSort</h2>

<p><em>You are given a list of numbers.</em></p>

<p><em>Write a script to implement JortSort. It should return true/false depending if the given list of numbers are already sorted.</em></p>

<p><em>Example 1:</em></p>

<pre><code>Input: @n = (1,2,3,4,5)
Output: 1

Since the array is sorted, it prints 1.
</code></pre>

<p><em>Example 2:</em></p>

<pre><code>Input: @n = (1,3,2,4,5)
Output: 0

Since the array is NOT sorted, it prints 0.
</code></pre>

<p>I had never heard about JortSort before. It seems to be a sorting toolkit, which, assuming I understood correctly, appears to be rather inefficient. To check whether an array of values is correctly sorted, it appears to sort the array and to compare the sorted result with the original array. Sorting an array usually has an algorithmic complexity of at least <code>O(n x log n)</code> (where <em>n</em> is the size of the array), whereas comparing each item with the preceding (or next) one in a simple loop has a linear complexity of <code>O(n)</code> and can thus be significantly faster. We will use the later solution.</p>

<h3>JortSort in Raku</h3>

<p>The built-in Raku <code>[]</code> <a href="https://docs.raku.org/language/operators#Reduction_metaoperators">reduction metaoperator</a> makes it possible to apply an operator to each pair of elements of a list. In our case, using it with the <code>&lt;=</code> operator, it will return <code>True</code> if each element is smaller than or equal to the next element. Since this operator returns a Boolean value (True or False), and since the task is to print 0 or 1, we simply numify the Boolean value by applying the unary <code>+</code> operator to the result. This is quite simple:</p>

<pre><code>use v6;

sub jortsort (@in) {
    + [&lt;=] @in;  # + numifies the Boolean result
}

for (1,2,3,4,5), (1,3,2,4,5) -&gt; @test {
    say "@test[] -&gt; ", jortsort @test;
}
</code></pre>

<p>This script displays the following output:</p>

<pre><code>$ raku ./jortsort.raku
1 2 3 4 5 -&gt; 1
1 3 2 4 5 -&gt; 0
</code></pre>

<p>Actually, this is so simple that we can easily make a very small Raku one-liner:</p>

<pre><code>$ raku -e 'say + [&lt;=] @*ARGS' 1 2 3 4 5
1

$ raku -e 'say + [&lt;=] @*ARGS' 1 2 4 3 5
0
</code></pre>

<h3>JortSort in Perl</h3>

<p>Perl doesn&#8217;t have a reduction meta-operator, but it is almost as simple to use a <code>for</code> loop and compare each element with the previous one. We return 0 if any pair of elements fails the comparison test, and return 1 if the loop reaches the array last item:</p>

<pre><code>use strict;
use warnings;
use feature "say";

sub jortsort {
    my @in = @_;
    for my $i (1..$#in) {
        return 0 if $in[$i - 1] &gt; $in[$i];
    }
    return 1;
}

for my $a ([1,2,3,4,5], [1,3,2,4,5]) {
    say "@$a -&gt; ", jortsort @$a;
}
</code></pre>

<p>This script displays the following output:</p>

<pre><code>$ perl jortsort.pl
1 2 3 4 5 -&gt; 1
1 3 2 4 5 -&gt; 0
</code></pre>

<h2>Task 2: Long Primes</h2>

<p><em>Write a script to generate first 5 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_reptend_prime">Long Primes</a>.</em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A prime number (p) is called Long Prime if (1/p) has an infinite decimal expansion repeating every (p-1) digits.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Example:</em></p>

<pre><code>7 is a long prime since 1/7 = 0.142857142857...
The repeating part (142857) size is 6 i.e. one less than the prime number 7.

Also 17 is a long prime since 1/17 = 0.05882352941176470588235294117647...
The repeating part (0588235294117647) size is 16 i.e. one less than the prime number 17.

Another example, 2 is not a long prime as 1/2 = 0.5.
There is no repeating part in this case.
</code></pre>

<h3>Long Primes in Raku</h3>

<p>Raku has a built-in method, <a href="https://docs.raku.org/routine/base-repeating">base-repeating</a>, provided by the role <code>Rational</code>, that splits a Rational into a base and a repeating pattern part. So we simply loop through an infinite lazy list of prime integers and return True is the repeating part is one less than the input prime, and we stop the loop when we have enough long primes.</p>

<pre><code>my @primes = grep { .is-prime }, 1..Inf;
my $count = 0;

sub is-long-prime ( UInt $den) {
    my ($non-rep, $repeating) = (1 / $den).base-repeating;
    return True if $repeating.chars == $den - 1;
}
for @primes -&gt; $candidate {
    say $candidate and ++$count if is-long-prime $candidate;
    last if $count &gt;= 5
}
</code></pre>

<p>This script displays the following output:</p>

<pre><code>$ raku ./long-primes.raku
7
17
19
23
29
</code></pre>

<h3>Long Primes in Perl</h3>

<p>In Perl, we implement a <code>generate_primes</code> subroutine to generate a list of prime numbers. We also implement an <code>invert</code> subroutine to compute the inverse <code>1/n</code> of the input integer <code>n</code>; we do this because we need this inverse to have a relatively large number of significant decimal digits (more than what Perl arithmetic division can provide). Then we use a regular expression to find possible repeating sequences smaller than the input prime. The first 3 primes (2, 3, and 5) behave somewhat differently from the subsequent primes and are not long primes so, rather than implementing another test specifically for them, we really start our search at the fourth prime, 7. Frankly, I&#8217;m really not sure that my regex works correctly for moderately or very large input values, but it does work fine for values much larger than just the first five long primes.</p>

<pre><code>use strict;
use warnings;
use feature "say";
use constant MAX =&gt; 800;

my $count = 0;

sub generate_primes {  
    my @primes = (2, 3, 5, 7);
    my $current = 9;
    while (1) {
        my $prime = 1;   # True
        for my $i (@primes) {
            my $i_sq = $i * $i;
            last if $i_sq &gt; $current;
            $prime = 0, last if $current % $i == 0;
        }
        push @primes, $current if $prime;;
        $current += 2;
        last if $current &gt; MAX;
    }
    return @primes;
}

sub invert {
    my $n = shift;
    my $dividend = 1;
    my $result;
    my $max = 2 * $n;
    while (1) {
        $dividend *= 10;
        $result .= int($dividend / $n);
        return $result if length $result &gt;= $n;
        my $remainder = $dividend % $n;
        $dividend = $remainder;
    }
    return $result;
}   

my @primes = generate_primes;
for my $candidate (@primes[3..30]) {

    my $decimals = invert $candidate;
    my $len = length $decimals;
    ++$count and say "$candidate  $decimals " unless $decimals =~  /(\d{3,$len})\1/;
    last if $count &gt;= 5;
}
</code></pre>

<p>In this implementation, the program displays the long primes detected, as well as the decimal digit sequences for those primes, to help checking the results. The changes to be made to remove the decimal digit sequences should be obvious. As it is, this program displays the following output:</p>

<pre><code>$ perl long-primes.pl
7  1428571
17  05882352941176470
19  0526315789473684210
23  04347826086956521739130
29  03448275862068965517241379310
</code></pre>

  Native GitHub actions in Perl
</h2>

<p><a href="https://dev.to/thibaultduponchelle/the-ephemeral-miniconf-speaker-annoucement-4n8f">Juan Juli√°n Merelo Guerv√≥s</a> presented maybe the more "Devops" talk of the miniconf (competing with Jos√© Joaqu√≠n Atria) about GitHub actions and containers. Perl is originally probably the best tool for sysadmin and devops (because it's close to system, very UNIX oriented, easy to deal with processus and files...) and GitHub actions (or Orb or whatever) provide a fantastic facility (with <code>perl</code> always there) for continuous integration, continuous test and CD/CD. </p>

<p><a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--LQw7CtFo--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/d3mzibsitm8pe74dggf7.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--LQw7CtFo--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/d3mzibsitm8pe74dggf7.png" alt="JJ Merelo" width="576" height="328"></a></p>

<p>I'm personally well versed in this area, but it has to be spread more generally in the Perl community (I see you <a class="mentioned-user" href="https://dev.to/szabgab">@szabgab</a>
)</p>

<p>It was a very clean and professional talk, did I say we had only experienced speakers?</p>

<h2>
  <a href="#do-you-really-know-xml">
  </a>
  Do you really know XML?
</h2>

<p>This title probably makes you not dream that much but during the creation of an <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/XML::Minifier">XML module for minification</a>, I had to dig very deep in XML features and spec (and libxml2 code) to cover all cases. </p>

<p>This presentation requires you to know XML (who does not!) to look with me at "corner invalid syntax things" (nested comments, duplicate attribute...), security (Billion Laughs attack, XXE injections, Quadratic blowup...), "lesser known" XML features (xml::space, DTD default attribute). <br>
<a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--uBaZCDRy--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/92sfn0i2ail9vn7a2e1m.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--uBaZCDRy--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/92sfn0i2ail9vn7a2e1m.png" alt="Tib" width="880" height="486"></a><br>
Then I browsed all possible libxml2 parsed node types spending more time on the ones that are "mysterious" (because this is where is the fun actually) and finally talked about how do I managed (DWIM) XML minification.</p>

  Automatic Observability
</h2>

<p><a href="https://dev.to/thibaultduponchelle/the-ephemeral-miniconf-jose-joaquin-atria-2m5h">Jos√© Joaqu√≠n Atria</a> came with a solid technical talk about Perl and <a href="https://newrelic.com/">NewRelic</a> monitoring. His talk is built upon the creation of <a href="https://github.com/cv-library/NewFangle-Agent">NewFangle::Agent</a> which allows you to easily monitor deep Perl trace events in NewRelic. <br>

As I said, very solid talk (he is experienced), I always enjoy native topics (I'm hanging out on <a href="https://www.irc.perl.org/channels.html">#native channel on IRC</a> üòÄ)</p>

<p>As I said and repeat, <a href="https://fr.openfoodfacts.org/">Open Food Facts</a> is a real Perl flagship. It's for me a model of successful Free Software project, and a very pragmatic one above all.</p>

     <div class="card-body">       <div class="card-text">
        <p>I registered on blogs.perl.org today so that I could comment on posts about object systems.  However, the very first thing I encountered was a password page with NO SSL.  So, even though I have a ton to say about object systems, my first blog post will instead be about setting up SSL.</p>

<p>(I&#8217;m aware that this is a &#8220;legacy server problem&#8221; but I also recently learned that it doesn&#8217;t matter with traefik.)</p>

<p>In this grand year of 2021 you can add SSL to any site, on any architecture, for free, by adding 3 files to your server, making one small config change to Apache, and running a service.  We are <i>truly</i> living in the future.</p>

<h2>traefik</h2>

<p>is the first file.  It comes from <a href="https://github.com/traefik/traefik/releases">https://github.com/traefik/traefik/releases</a>, and there is one for any architecture, for instance:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/traefik/traefik/releases/download/v2.5.4/traefik_v2.5.4_linux_amd64.tar.gz">traefik<em>v2.5.4</em>linux_amd64.tar.gz</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/traefik/traefik/releases/download/v2.5.4/traefik_v2.5.4_linux_386.tar.gz">traefik<em>v2.5.4</em>linux_386.tar.gz</a></li>
</ul>

<p>The archive contains one binary, named &#8216;traefik&#8217;.  It is a universal Linux static binary and does not depend on any library in the host system.  Traefik is a reverse proxy, with lots of good defaults, and lots of features, most of which this guide is ignoring.  The feature that we are going for is the automatic LetsEncrypt support built into traefik.</p>

<p>Put this file somewhere like /usr/local/bin/traefik</p>

<pre>wget https://github.com/traefik/traefik/releases/download/v2.5.4/traefik_v2.5.4_linux_amd64.tar.gz
tar -xzf traefik_v2.5.4_linux_amd64.tar.gz
mkdir -p /usr/local/bin
mv traefik /usr/local/bin/
</pre>

<h2>traefik.toml</h2>

<p>is the second file.  You can actually configure traefik with yaml or json as well, but I happen to have .toml files on hand, and toml is a little less likely to get whitespace-dammaged during copy/paste.</p>

<pre><code>
[entryPoints.http]
  address = ":80"
[entryPoints.https]
  address = ":443"
[entryPoints.traefik]
  address = "localhost:9999"
#[api]
#  insecure = true
#  dashboard = true
#  debug = true
[providers.file]
  directory = "/etc/traefik/conf"
  watch = true
[certificatesResolvers.le.acme]
  email = "hostmaster@perl.org"
  storage = "/etc/traefik/acme.json"
  caServer = "https://acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory"
  #caServer = "https://acme-staging-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory"
[certificatesResolvers.le.acme.httpChallenge]
  entryPoint = "http"
</code></pre>

<p>Put this at /etc/traefik/traefik.toml</p>

<h2>blogs.perl.org.toml</h2>

<p>is the third file.  This describes how traefik should proxy your back-end service.  It goes into a different config file because it is part of the &#8220;dynamic config&#8221; rather than the &#8220;static config&#8221;.  You can update any of the files in the dynamic config on the fly and traefik will pick up the changes automatically without any signaling or restart.</p>

<pre><code>
#[http.middlewares.https_redirect.redirectScheme]
#  scheme = "https"

[http.routers.blogs]
  entryPoints = ["http"]
#  middlewares = ["https_redirect"]
  service = "blogs"
  rule = "Host(`blogs.perl.org`)"

[http.routers.blogstls]
  entryPoints = ["https"]
  service = "blogs"
  rule = "Host(`blogs.perl.org`)"
  [http.routers.blogstls.tls]
    certResolver = "le"
    [[http.routers.blogstls.tls.domains]]
      main = "blogs.perl.org"

[http.services.blogs.loadBalancer]
  passHostHeader = true
  [[http.services.blogs.loadBalancer.servers]]
    url = "http://localhost:8080/"
</code></pre>

<p>Put this at /etc/traefik/conf/blogs.perl.org.toml</p>

<h2>Apache Config Change</h2>

<p>Next, you need apache to listen on a different port than 80.  Why does traefik need 80? because the LetsEncrypt registration requires challenges to be found at port 80, and Traefik is automatically creating these responses.  The configs above assume apache is moved to port 8080 on localhost.</p>

<p>Apache configurations vary widely per Linux distribution, so I can&#8217;t really guess at the location of these files, but if you search for</p>

<pre>egrep -Ri '(listen|virtualhost).*80' /etc/apache*</pre>

<p>you should see it.  Simply change all occurrences of :80 to localhost:8080 and restart apache.</p>

<h2>Running Traefik</h2>

<p>This is another varies-by-distro situation.  You want to run Traefik as a service at startup.  </p>

<p>With SysV init, this means creating an init script.  Traefik does not provide one (as traefik is typically run inside docker) but <a href="https://gist.github.com/yaxin-cn/3f134bfcdec97812e66e82e798cf2308">github user yaxin-cn shared one</a>.</p>

<p>With systemd, you need a service file.  The traefik project <a href="https://github.com/traefik/traefik/blob/master/contrib/systemd/traefik.service">provides one</a>.  There is also a nice <a href="https://gist.github.com/ubergesundheit/7c9d875befc2d7bfd0bf43d8b3862d85">write-up of the steps by github user ubergesundheit</a>.</p>

<h2>Debugging</h2>

<p>If all goes as planned, you should suddenly be able to access https://blogs.perl.org, and &#8220;just work&#8221;.  Since that seldom happens, you&#8217;ll see above in traefik.toml where I commented out the &#8220;[api]&#8221; keys.  Un-comment those, and now you can access traefik&#8217;s dashboard on localhost:9999.  To reach that, you likely need an ssh tunnel:</p>

<pre>ssh -L9999:localhost:9999 blogs.perl.org</pre>

<p>Now you can browse to localhost:9999 and see traefik&#8217;s interpretation of the live state of your config files.  Tinker with the configs until all errors are resolved.</p>

<p>As a final consideration, there is a commented-out middleware in blogs.perl.org.toml, which redirects http to https.  Once you have https fully working, you can un-comment that to push everyone over to SSL.  You might decide not to do that for some reason, but keep in mind that Google gives a boost to sites that force SSL, making the blogs more visible.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading!  And thanks for hosting a community forum!</p>

     <div class="card-body">       <div class="card-text"><p>Hi there</p>
<p>Going back to the editorial of last week's <a href="https://perlweekly.com/archive/537.html">edition</a> of Perl Weekly, it is still there in my head raising many questions. It is a universal fact that Perl is no longer the favourite language among the youths in college these days. I remember when I was first introduced to Perl in 1999, it was the most popular language. Being a Perl fan, I feel it is my responsibility to bring Perl back to the discussion table. One way to do that is to talk about Perl-based projects and share them with the users of other languages. I have noticed that not as many people blog about Perl as they used to in the past. Talking about blogs, I would like to thank <a href="https://theweeklychallenge.org">The Weekly Challenge</a> team for spreading the power of Perl. For the record, in the last 138 weeks, the team have created and shared over 2000 blog posts. I used to blog regularly in the past but nowadays I hardly find time. Having said that, I still wrte a monthly report blog post where I talk about Perl and my other projects. I find making a live video is less time consuming than writing a blog post. I made some and then I stopped that as well, sorry. You can take a look my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/mohammadsajidanwar">YouTube Channel</a> if you fancy. I came across series of <a href="https://perlmaven.com/beginner-perl-maven-video-course">videos</a> by Gabor Szabo teaching Perl. It is great source for someone new to Perl and explore with live action.</p>
<p>I remember, Dave Cross, wrote a <a href="https://dev.to/davorg/don-t-be-a-perl-programmer-4h2d">blog post</a> talking about something that not many people would speak about. I personally agree with him fully and believe knowing more than one programming languages helps you as a programmer. I can tell from my own experience, I picked up Raku last year while participating the weekly challenge. Whatever little I know about Raku to date, I can tell it has helped me a lot. I use that knowledge to write better Perl programs. Recently, I started writing Python as well - just the basics for now. So the question is, does knowing Raku or Python make me any less of a Perl programmer? I am still a Perl programmer and all of my thought processes still follow Perl's rules. Perl is my first love and will remain so for the rest of my life. Even today, after more than 22 years, I find features that I never knew existed before, especially in the field of regex. I would like to give credit to Abigail for sharing the magic of regex in Perl as part of his weekly contributions.</p>
<p>While talking about blogs, how can I miss those who are doing great service on a regular basis?

<p><a href="https://en.perlzemi.com/">Perl Zemi | Perl Zemi|Perl Installation, Perl Tutorial, Many Examples</a></p>

<p>Perl Zemi is Japanese Perl Tutorial site which is well known and red in Japan. Most of all Japanese Perl users know Perl Zemi and read the document repeatedly.</p>

<p>The volume of content is large and has a reputation for being easy to understand.</p>

<p>This site is originally Japanese. I started to translate this site into English at 2021-11 using an automatically translation tool. I plan that the not very good descriptions and examples by the automatic translation will be gradually fixed until 2023-01.</p>

<p>I'm really going to achieve it.</p>

<p>Let's enjoy Perl with me!</p>

<p>Talks need to be prerecorded and uploaded prior to the conference, which are then streamed to participants with Q&amp;A after each.</p>

<p>Before we request the room from FOSDEM and call for speakers, we need volunteers to assist with both organizing and supporting speakers.</p>

<p>We need 2-3 people who can meet regularly and spend time planning it, encouraging calls for papers, helping speakers record their talks as needed, supporting the management of our dev room on the day, including the collation of recordings etc.</p>

<p>If you can commit to support, we can submit a proposal for dev room (deadline is 23:59 UTC, Monday 15 November).</p>

<p>Please contact nic@perlfoundation.org by 12 noon UTC, Monday 15 November if you can help. </p>

     <p>Daniel Sockwell has provided two updates to his <a href="https://news.perlfoundation.org/post/grant_proposal_persistent_data_structures_for_raku">Grant: Persistent Data Structures for Raku</a>.</p>

<p>The first update was already submitted in October, and not posted due to my own error. Enjoy the thorough description!</p>

<h2>Raku Persistent Data Structures Grant Report for September 2021</h2>

<p>In September, I spent 28 hours on implementing Raku persistent data structures.  That's a bit under
the 10 hour/week I'd estimated that I'd spend, but I was still able to make a good start on the
implementation.</p>

<p>The main reason I didn't spend the full 40 hours on the grant ‚Äì as well as the explanation for why
you're getting this update now instead of closer to the beginning of the month ‚Äì is that I decided
to devote a large chunk of my Raku time to two other issues ‚Äì both of which are directly related to
implementing persistent data structures.  (Though not <em>so</em> related that I'm counting time spent on
them towards the grant.  Which is good, because doing so would mean that I <em>well</em> exceeded my
~40/month budget!)</p>

<p>I'm going to tell you a bit about these two projects and how each relates to Raku persistent data
structures, and then I'll describe the progress I made during the 28 hours I'm actually counting.</p>

<h3>What even is immutability?</h3>

<p>The biggest selling point of persistent data structures is, of course, that they are immutable while
also being fairly cheap to copy.  But to deliver on that promise, it's important to have a very
clear idea of what we mean by "immutability".</p>

<p>I don't mean in some sort of fancy <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heraclitus">philosophical sense</a>;
I'm asking the very practical question "When we describe the <code>List</code> in <code>my $list = (1, 2, 3)</code> as
immutable, what does that mean?  What different <em>behavior</em> should I expect when I know that the
<code>List</code> is immutable?" (You could say "semantic difference" instead of "different behavior" if you
want to sound a bit more technical.)</p>

<p>Raku has some very clear answers to parts of this question but is also slightly confused (to say
nothing of confusing) on some others.  And, as it turns out, some of the less-clear areas of the
question end up being pretty significant for the sort of immutability that give persistent data
structures so much of their power. </p>

<p>Let's start with an area where Raku is clear: the distinction between immutable <strong>values</strong> and
immutable <strong>bindings</strong>.  This is <a href="https://docs.raku.org/language/containers">well documented</a> (and
isn't what I spent time on; this is still background), but here's a recap:</p>

<h4>Values</h4>

<p>When we describe the list <code>(1, 2, 3)</code>, the string <code>codesections</code>, or the number <code>42</code> as
immutable, we are saying that they are immutable <em>values</em>.  That is, there's no way to take <code>(1, 2,
3)</code> and change the <code>2</code> into a <code>0</code> while still having the same list we started with ‚Äì we can create a
new list with those values, but that's not at all the same thing.  Contrast that with the <code>Array</code> of
<code>my @a = [1, 2, 3]</code>: here, the code <code>@a[1] = 0</code> literally changes the existing <code>Array</code>.</p>

<p>Strings and numbers in Raku are immutable values in exactly the way <code>List</code>s are (and <code>Array</code>s
aren't).  That is, there's no way to transform a string or a number; all you can do is to return a
modified version of the string or number.  In contrast, C, C++, Rust, and many other languages allow
you to mutate strings in-place; they essentially treat strings as arrays of characters or codepoints
and let you modify that array in exactly the same way Rakoons modify an <code>Array</code>.  (For C's <code>char*</code>
strings, you're literally dealing with character arrays; for other languages that's more of an
(over) simplification).  I'm pretty sure that no programming language is crazy enough <a href="http://rigaux.org/language-study/various/mutability-and-sharing/">to have
mutable numbers</a> (math would get
<em>weird</em>) but I'd love to learn that I'm wrong about that.</p>

<p>Note that I'm discussing the semantics of immutable values that Raku (the language) provides, not
implementation details of how any particular compiler stores those values.  So, while <code>List</code>s and
<code>Str</code>s provide immutable semantics, there's nothing preventing an implementation from storing
different values in a more complex way.  Put differently, when you say <code>my $a = 'foo' x 500; my $b =
$a ~ ' and bar'</code>, you <em>conceptually</em> have two separate and immutable strings, but implementations
are free to let those strings share (or even mutate) some of their backing data.  And, indeed, MoarVM
uses a really amazing system for <a href="https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/blob/master/docs/sts.asciidoc">storing
strings</a> that shares memory in a way
that's not that different from the way the data structures I'm building do.</p>

<h4>Bindings</h4>

<p>Entirely separate from the question of mutable versus immutable values, programming languages can
also constrain the mutability of variable bindings.  That is: once the programmer has defined a
variable as pointing at a particular value, can they later change it to point at a <em>different</em>
value?</p>

<p>One non-Raku example that many programmers may be familiar with is JavaScript's <code>let</code> and <code>const</code>,
especially when used with arrays or objects.  In JavaScript, <code>const</code> enforces immutable bindings ‚Äì
you can't say <code>const a = [1, 2, 3]; a = [4, 5, 6]</code>.  But it does nothing to make the <em>values</em>
immutable ‚Äì and, in js, arrays are always mutable.  This means that you can validly write <code>const a =
[1, 2, 3]; a[1] = 99</code> to mutate the value that <code>a</code> points to.  (This distinction, and the lack of
immutable arrays in JavaScript, leads to <a href="https://overreacted.io/on-let-vs-const/">perennial
debates</a> about the advisability of using <code>const</code> in js.)</p>

<p>Raku gives us accesses to the semantics of both mutable and immutable bindings, and lets us combine
either with mutable or immutable values.  Thus, we can write <code>my @a = [1, 2, 3]</code> - mutable binding
to a mutable value.  Or <code>my $l = (1, 2, 3)</code> ‚Äì an mutable binding to an immutable value (we can't
change the value of the <code>List</code>, but we <em>can</em> make <code>$l</code> point to a different value altogether).  Or
we can write <code>constant @a = [1, 2, 3]</code> ‚Äì an immutable binding to a mutable value (<code>@a</code> will always
point to that exact <code>Array</code>, but we can freely mutate that <code>Array</code> with code like <code>@a[1] = 99</code>).
Or, finally, we can write <code>constant $l = (1, 2, 3)</code> ‚Äì an immutable binding to an immutable value
(<code>$l</code> will always point to the same <code>List</code>, and that <code>List</code> will always contain exactly the values
<code>1</code>, <code>2</code>, and <code>3</code>).</p>

<p>This last category ‚Äì an immutable binding to an immutable value ‚Äì best fits many peoples intuitions
about what the terms "immutable" or "constant" mean ‚Äì that variable always gives me the same value,
no matter what.  In addition to being more intuitive, this last category is notable for how much it
can simplify reasoning about code.  There's something very clarifying about knowing the value of a
variable without needing to track whether that value has changed; just like the related idea of
using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referential_transparency">referentially transparent</a> functions,
programming with variables that are immutably bound to immutable values can greatly simplify complex
codebases.</p>

<h4>How immutable values and binding fit with persistent data structures</h4>

<p>The distinction between the mutability of values and bindings matters for the data structures I'm
implementing in two ways.</p>

<p>First, because the data structures I'm creating are immutable values, we'll be able to use them to
be in that wonderful forth category ‚Äì immutable binding to immutable values ‚Äì if and only if Raku
lets us bind to them immutably.  So it's really important to be clear on what options Raku provides
for immutable bindings.</p>

<p>I've already shown one way that Raku supports immutable bindings: <code>constant $l = (1, 2, 3)</code>.  But
constants are evaluated at compile time and (even though Raku's definition of "compile time" is
pretty expansive) the options for using constants are inherently limited.  So what other options
does Raku provide?</p>

<p>Well, before the beginning of September, I thought that Raku provided three other options for
immutable bindings: so-called <a href="https://docs.raku.org/language/variables#index-entry-_(sigilless_variables)">sigilless
variables</a> (like <code>my
\l = (1, 2, 3)</code>); function parameters that aren't declared as <a href="https://docs.raku.org/type/Signature#index-entry-trait_is_rw"><code>rw</code> or
<code>copy</code></a> (like <code>sub fn($l) {‚Ä¶}</code>); and
lists of variables that are destructured with the <code>:=</code> operator (which share the same semantics as
parameters).  Now, in mid-October, I <strong>still</strong> think that's the case, but I admit that the situation
is more complex than I first thought and, at a minimum, existing compilers don't fully implement
those semantics.</p>

<p>(Note: some people don't like the term "sigilless variable", since the semantics I just described
mean that they don't really vary.  But it's the term the docs use, so I'm going to stick with it for
this post.)</p>

<p>I first realized something odd was going on when comment in this <a href="https://github.com/Raku/doc/issues/3950">docs.raku.org
issue</a> pointed out that, while you can't reassign a
sigilless variable, you can sometimes re-<a href="https://docs.raku.org/language/containers#Binding">bind</a>
it: <code>my Int \x = 2; x := 4</code> changes the value bound to <code>x</code>.  At first I thought that this issue only
applied when certain type constraints were applied, but I soon realized that it applied whenever
any type is mentioned, including <code>Any</code> or <code>Mu</code>.  Moreover, it's not just sigilless variables that
can be rebound ‚Äì parameters can too: <code>sub f(Any $a) { $a := 42; $a}; f 0</code> returns 42.  In the last
step to make this pervasive, the <code>@</code> and <code>%</code> sigils add implicit type constraints, which means that
any parameter with either of those sigils can be rebound.  (As mentioned, destructuring with <code>:=</code>
shares the semantics of parameter binding, all of that applies there as well.)</p>

<p>Given that sigilless variables and parameters both allowed rebinding, all of the above lead me to
wonder whether Raku is trying to provide immutable bindings at all.  It turns out that there isn't a
<a href="https://github.com/Raku/roast">Roast</a> specification test that's 100% on point.  And, when I <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/69231506/what-are-the-rules-for-re-binding">asked
on StackOverflow</a> I
mixed opinions about whether the current behavior (allowing rebinding) was intentional or a bug.</p>

<p>If Raku does pervasively allow rebinding, that would be pretty bad news for the usefulness of the
data structures I'm implementing.  They'd still have some value ‚Äì more than enough to be
worthwhile.  But it'd mean that we pretty much can never get to the
immutable-bindings-to-immutable-values promised land that can have such a simplifying effect on
code.</p>

<p>Given that impact, I decided to research the issue pretty thoroughly.  After doing so, I've
concluded that Raku is designed to provide immutable bindings after all, and I produced a <a href="https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/pull/4536">pull
request</a> that both explains my logic and provides a
patch that gives Raku those semantics.  That PR hasn't been merged yet (I still need to respond to
at least one change request about what error to throw, and I'd like to see if anyone else weighs
in).  But I'm optimistic that it will be and that fixing that bug will make immutable bindings to
immutable values much more practical in Raku.</p>

<h4>What's on the inside</h4>

<p>I mentioned earlier that the values-versus-binding distinction is important for the work I'm doing
in two ways.  The second way it matters is because it gives us the right framework to talk about
"shallow" immutability (also sometimes called <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/69231506/what-are-the-rules-for-re-binding">interior
mutability</a>).</p>

<p>Lets look at a slightly different constant: <code>constant $l = (1, 2, $)</code>.  What can we say about <code>$l</code>?
Well, the variable <code>$l</code> is immutably bound to a <code>List</code>, and the <code>List</code> is comprised of three values,
<code>1</code>, <code>2</code>, and ‚Ä¶ a <a href="https://docs.raku.org/language/containers#Scalar_containers">scalar</a>.  But a
scalar a container ‚Äì specifically, a <em>mutable</em> container.  Thus, despite the immutability of <code>$l</code>'s
binding and the immutability of <code>List</code>s, we can still make changes: <code>$l[2] = 99</code> is valid code.</p>

<p>That change is allowed because <code>List</code>s are only <em>shallowly</em> immutable.  Or, to say the same thing in
different words, <code>List</code>s are an immutable type that allows for interior mutability.</p>

<p>One of the goals I mentioned in the <a href="https://news.perlfoundation.org/post/grant_proposal_persistent_data_structures_for_raku">initial grant proposal for the persistent data
structures</a>
is to provide deeply immutable data types.  I hope that the discussion so far gives some context to what I
meant by that.  But it's a point I'll return to in a just a minute.</p>

<h3>Meanwhile, in another thread altogether‚Ä¶</h3>

<p>The second related-but-distinct task has occupied a good deal of my time recently has involved
concurrency and parallelism (which are famously <a href="https://go.dev/blog/waza-talk">not the same
thing</a>).  One of the key selling points of immutable data ‚Äì
especially deeply immutable data ‚Äì is that it can be more easily shared across threads.  A lot of
the headache of dealing with parallel code (locks, mutexes, atomics, cache misses, deadlocks,
livelocks, etc) come from ways to prevent different threads from modifying data at the same time.
But different threads will never modify (deeply) immutable data at the same time ‚Äì because <em>nothing</em>
will ever mutate that data at any time.  I'm very optimistic that the data structures I'm working on
will have significant application for anyone writing multithreaded Raku. </p>

<p>So I've been slightly concerned that I hadn't yet written any non-trivial parallel and concurrent
code in Raku.  Not <em>that</em> concerned ‚Äì I've written quite a bit of concurrent and parallel Rust code
and concurrent JavaScript (JS is single-threaded, so it's inherently non-parallel).  And I'd gotten
to know Raku's concurrency model by watching some excellent
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hGyzsviI48M&amp;t=43s">conference</a>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2fSbOPeSQs&amp;t=1184s">talks</a> and by reading the
<a href="https://docs.raku.org/language/concurrency">docs</a>/<a href="https://6guts.wordpress.com/2017/11/24/a-unified-and-improved-supply-concurrency-model/">other</a>
<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/65473206/what-concurrency-mechanisms-are-provided-by-raku-and-how-can-they-be-evaluated">resources</a>.
Still, though, I was keeping my eye out for a medium-scale project that would let me confirm my
understanding of Raku's approach to concurrency.</p>

<p>In late September, I found the perfect project.  Someone on the r/rakulang subreddit asked if there
was a good way to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rakulang/comments/pvdpd2/recreate_javascript_bouncing_balls_in_raku/">recreate a JavaScript exercise in
Raku</a>.
That exercise involved rendering balls to an HTML5 canvas in a browser ‚Äì a task that's pretty
challenging with a version of Raku running on MoarVM.  (It would obviously be much easier using the
JavaScript backend, but that wouldn't currently be my first choice for someone new to Raku.)  So, I
decided to write a simple <a href="https://cro.services/">Cro</a> server that would let someone write Raku code
to display balls on an HTML canvas.</p>

<p>Specifically, I decided on the following architecture: A Cro server that would listen for commands
from the user's Raku code, generate a set of balls to display, and then send a JSON representation
of those balls to any connected clients via WebSockets.  Oh, and then do that again with updated
ball positions 16 milliseconds later ‚Äì with the goal of maintaining a frame rate of 60 fps.  It's
this last bit would normally be a bit of an odd choice: WebSockets are typically used to communicate
with a remote server, and thus it'd typically be a questionable choice to stream updates 60 times
per second.  But the program I had in mind would run locally, which removes network latency from
consideration.  And, besides, I figured that this design would provide good trial by fire for my
understanding of Raku's concurrency model: if my program can stream balls to dozens of
simultaneously connected clients at 60 fps, I must have a pretty decent understanding of how Raku
handles parallelism and concurrency.</p>

<p>You can see the <a href="https://github.com/codesections/LearnRakuWith">program I ended up with</a> on GitHub.
I'm pretty happy with how it turned out: in not much more than 100 lines of Raku, the program sets
up exactly the architecture described above plus an
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erlang_(programming_language)">Erlang</a>-style error recovery strategy
for resetting to a known-good state when user input that doesn't produce valid output.</p>

<p>But getting there took longer than I expected it to and, in the middle, had me seriously questioning
whether I actually understood Raku's concurrency model well enough to be implementing new data
structures that'd fit with it.  One of the first things anyone learns about programming is that "<a href="https://blog.plover.com/2017/11/12/">it
is not a compiler error. It is never a compiler error.</a>"  In
other words, even if some issue <em>seems</em> to be caused by a bug in the compiler/runtime/etc, it's far
more likely to be caused by a bug in your own code.</p>

<p>And when writing that module, I kept running into some crashes that made me think that I'd either
run into the mythical compiler bug or ‚Äì more likely ‚Äì was seriously misunderstanding how to write
concurrent code.  After spending quite a bit of time double-checking my code, I determined that, as
expected, I had <em>not</em> run into a compiler bug.  No, I'd run into
<a href="https://github.com/croservices/cro-websocket/issues/36">two</a> of
<a href="https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/issues/1565">them</a>.</p>

<p>In fairness, neither was a <em>compiler</em> bug; they were both issues with the MoarVM runtime.  Moreover,
both were fixed extremely quickly, and the second never even made it into production ‚Äì I only ran
into it because I was using a pre-release build to try out Rakudo's <a href="https://6guts.wordpress.com/2021/09/29/the-new-moarvm-dispatch-mechanism-is-here/">new dispatch
mechanism</a>.  The
whole point of running pre-release builds is to help catch edge-case bugs like these, and I'm
certainly not complaining ‚Äì but it turns out that streaming 60 fps to dozens of clients was a good
stress test for the new dispatch system and not just for my understanding of Raku's concurrency
model.</p>

<h3>Lessons for persistent data structures</h3>

<p>Once I realized that I wasn't fundamentally misunderstanding concurrency in Raku, implementing
Learn::Raku::With taught me a couple of lessons with important (though subtle) implication for the
persistent data structures I'm building.</p>

<h4>"Concurrency control" ‚â† "concurrency"</h4>

<p>The first lesson I learned is that I'd slightly misunderstood what's going on in code like this
(adapted from <a href="https://docs.raku.org/routine/migrate">an example</a> in the docs):</p>

<p>```raku</p>

<h1>A simple stock ticker for Apple and Google stock</h1>

<p>react {
    whenever $stock-info-for-APPL { say "Apple's stock price is now:  $_ " }
    whenever $stock-info-for-GOOG { say "Google's stock price is now: $_ " }
}
```</p>

<p>My previous (<strong>incorrect</strong>) reading of that example was pretty much just an English version of the
code:</p>

<p>&gt; Whenever we get an update about either Apple or Google's stock, print that update.  We don't know
&gt; when these updates could come, but we want to react to them the instant they do, whether that
&gt; means reacting to the Apple one first, reacting to the Google one first, or reacting to both at
&gt; the same time.</p>

<p>That's <em>so close</em> to correct, but it goes wrong in the very last 7 words: we are guaranteed <strong>not</strong>
to react to both updates at the same time.  This is a consequence of Raku's
<a href="https://6guts.wordpress.com/2017/11/24/a-unified-and-improved-supply-concurrency-model/#user-content-supplies-and-concurrency">run-to-completion</a>
semantics: the code inside a <code>whenever</code> block is guaranteed to finish executing (that is, to "run to
completion") before the code in any other <code>whenever</code> block can start.  This wouldn't matter much for
the simple example above, but here are two modified versions in which it would:</p>

<p>```raku</p>

<h1>Lets store our results in a Map instead of printing them</h1>

<p>react {
    my %prices is Map;
    react {
        my Map $prices = Map.new;
        whenever $stock-info-for-APPL { $prices = %(|$prices, :APPL($<em>)) }
        whenever $stock-info-for-GOOG { $prices = %(|$prices, :GOOG($</em>)) }
    }
}
```</p>

<p>Under the incorrect understanding, we could've be in both <code>whenever</code> blocks at the same time and
this would create a race condition ‚Äì we might lose a price update if two came in at the same time.
However, because the concurrency control Raku provides <em>prevents</em> concurrent access here, this is
actually 100% fine: we'll be in exactly one <code>whenever</code> block at a time.  Raku's semantics protect us
from any race condition.</p>

<p>Here's an example where Raku's semantics would have a less ideal impact on naive code:</p>

<p>```raku</p>

<h1>Now with buy/sell recomendations!</h1>

<p>react {
    whenever $stock-info-for-APPL { 
        say "Apple's stock price is now:  $_ ";
        say "Rating: " ~slow-fn-to-calculte-recomendation('APPL', $<em>);
    }
    whenever $stock-info-for-GOOG { 
        say "Google's stock price is now: $</em> ";
        say "Rating: " ~slow-fn-to-calculte-recomendation('GOOG', $_);
    }
}
```</p>

<p>This code would <em>not</em> behave as the author might hope, due to those same run-to-completion
semantics.  Specifically, while <code>slow-fn-to-calculate-recomendation</code> is running, other updates would
be blocked.  If you don't want this behavior, Raku offers several ways to schedule work outside of
the run-to-completion guarantee of the <code>whenever</code> block; Raku's semantics aren't going to <em>stop</em> you
from doing anything here, but it's important to understand the behavior they provide by default. </p>

<p>(It may be helpful to compare Raku's semantics to JavaScript, which guarantees that <em>every</em> function
will run to completion before any other work begins ‚Äì a model I've <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/67679309/raku-equivalent-to-javascripts-settimeoutfn-0">contrasted with Raku's
before</a>.)</p>

<p>So, how does all of this impact persistent data structures?  Well, some of the performance
optimizations for persistent data structures involve temporarily suspending the immutability
guarantee when there's provably only one copy of the data (or part of the data).  And whether that's
provably the case or not depends crucially on whether other sections of the program can have
concurrent access to the data.  So being clear on all of the above is pretty essential for safe
implementations of the data structures I'm working on.</p>

<h4>Under pressure</h4>

<p>I mentioned that implementing Learn::Raku::With helped me learn two lessons, but the second was
really a reminder of a Raku concurrency feature that I already knew about/a good example of how
important that feature can be.  The feature I'm talking about is the way Raku manages backpressure.</p>

<p>Raku's high level concurrency tools are carefully designed with backpressure in mind.  Quoting
directly from the <a href="https://6guts.wordpress.com/2017/11/24/a-unified-and-improved-supply-concurrency-model/">6guts blog
post</a> that
I've already linked to:</p>

<p>&gt; Another interesting problem for any system processing asynchronous messages is that of
&gt; backpressure. In short, how do we make a source of messages emit them at a rate no greater than
&gt; that of the processing logic? The general principle with Supply is that the sender of a message
&gt; pays the cost of its processing. So, if I have <code>$source.map(&amp;foo).tap(&amp;bar)</code>, then whatever emits at
&gt; the source pays the cost of the map of that message along with the processing done by the tap callback.</p>

<p>Backpreasure is extremely helpful because it can allow a program to handle arbitrary amounts of
input without requiring a proportionally arbitrary (i.e., infinite) amount of memory.  Of course,
given Raku's commitment to flexibility and programmer control, it shouldn't come as any surprise
that Raku also makes it easy to opt out of this automatic backpreasure when doing so makes sense.</p>

<p>Learn::Raku::With presents a good example of a situation where it makes sense to opt out of Raku's
default backpressure semantics.  As I mentioned above, Learn::Raku::With generates a stream of
frames and transmits those frames to all connected clients.  If we applied backpressure to this
system in the normal way, then transmitting the frames to the clients would exert backpressure on
generating the frames ‚Äì that is, we'd be guaranteed not to generate frames any faster than we can
transmit them.</p>

<p>This would have some benefits ‚Äì most notably, we'd never need to buffer generated frames and our
memory use would never grow.  But, in the Learn::Raku::With context, it'd have one very notable flaw
as well: the normal backpreasure system would mean that any time we can't transmit frames to clients
at 60 fps, the actual <em>speed</em> of Learn::Raku::With's balls would get reduced.  This obviously isn't
ideal ‚Äì while 60 fps is a nice goal to shoot for, 45 fps is an absolutely fine frame rate and it'd
be much better to drop 1 out of 4 frames and to display the balls at normal speed in 45 fps than to
keep every frame but to display the balls in slow motion.</p>

<p>Thus, Learn::Raku::With <a href="https://github.com/codesections/LearnRakuWith/blob/main/lib/HtmlBalls.rakumod#L70-L78">pairs a Supply with a
Channel</a> to
allow it to drop frames instead of generating frames more slowly ‚Äì but that, of course, means that
it needs to store at least a few frames at least temporarily.</p>

<p>But storing extra frames, in turn, means both that the program will take up more memory and,
crucially, that there will be more work for the garbage collector to do.  And that work will take
some time ‚Äì time that necessarily cannot be spent transmitting those frames to the client.  But
since the whole reason we need to store those extra frames was that we're generating them faster
than we can ship them off to the client, it's possible for the GC-pause-induced extra delay to
result in <em>more</em> extra frames.  Which can then result in more garbage to collect, and thus more
delay, and thus more frames.</p>

<p>I'm sure you can see where that sort of infinite loop heads and it's certainly not to anywhere
good.  In fact, a previous version of Learn::Raku::With could get itself into exactly that sort of
situation pretty easily, consuming ever-more RAM and operating ever more slowly (I think I measured
it as hitting at least 50 GB).  The current version is much more resilient, but the risk remains.</p>

<p>All of this is relevant to persistent data structures because one of the main benefits of these data
structures is that the power of structural sharing makes copies vastly less expensive ‚Äì verging on
free, in fact.  This benefit would go a long way towards avoiding the sort of issues I outlined
above.  I'd always known that these inexpensive copies are a key benefit of the persistent data
structures I'm building, but I'd previously focused on this as a way to reduce the memory footprint
of Raku programs.  After building Learn::Raku::With, however, I recognize that structural sharing
also reduces GC pressure and thus improves the speed at which Raku programs can execute ‚Äì which can
avoid the sort of death spirals described above.  This means that having persistent data structures
will not only make many Raku programs more memory efficient but will also certain of Raku programs
much more feasible to write without spiraling into a need for ever-increasing amounts of RAM.</p>

<h2>Implementation progress</h2>

<p>So, having spent a few thousand words explaining things related to but not directly covered by the
grant, let me say at least a bit about the implementation work itself.  In the nature of
implementation work, it's not nearly as interesting as more exploratory work and I don't have very
much to say ‚Äì I've very much stuck to the plan in my <a href="https://news.perlfoundation.org/post/grant_proposal_persistent_data_structures_for_raku">grant
proposal</a>.</p>

<p>Specifically, I started by implementing the persistent version of the <code>List</code> (still open to
bikeshedding on the name!).  I have made good progress on implementing a persistent <code>List</code> that with
the structural sharing features described in my proposal but <em>without</em> the bit-shifting indexing
(I'm instead currently using the simplified indexing scheme that involves converting the key to a
different base and calculating the relevant indices manually).  This simplified indexing scheme will
allow me to test the soundness of the list before switching to the bit-shifting index (which will be
key to the performance of the persistent list).</p>

<p>Additionally, I've written a set of tests to confirm the correctness of my implementation so far and
a (much smaller and still preliminary) set of tests that measure the performance of deep copies of
built in <code>List</code>s and <code>Array</code>s, which should provide a nice baseline to compare the persistent
versions against.</p>

<h1>Conclusion</h1>

<p>Over the course of September, I made a good start on implementing persistent data structures for
Raku.  This included significant, though limited, progress on actually implementing the persistent
List and much more time-consuming work on auxiliary projects (not counted as part of my grant hours)
that have given me a much better foundation for the remaining work.  The downside of this auxiliary
work is that it took up considerable time that I might have devoted to the actual implementation,
both in September and in October.  In fact, given the amount of time I've already spent on these
research/side projects in October, it's possible that I won't have much or any grant progress to
report at the end of this month.  Nevertheless, I'm glad I invested the effort into those projects
since I believe both left me significantly better equipped to carry out the remainder of the grant.
I look forward to putting these lessons into practice as I continue to implement persistent data
structures for Raku.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Raku Persistent Data Structures Grant Report for October 2021</h2>

<p>The expectation I mentioned in my September grant report came true in October: I had significantly
less time to devote to work on this grant in October.  This was due in large part to the conceptual
work I previously reported on, which stretched well into October.</p>

<p>Accordingly, I was only able to spend 5 hours on the grant in October; I used that time to continue
work on the persistent List.  Specifically, I nearly completed the basic API (without the
bit-shifting optimizations).  I was also able to add some initial test coverage. Given that
progress, I am now nearing point where I'll be able to share the WIP code publicly.</p>

<p>On the conceptual front (i.e., work that's relevant to the persistent data structures but not
relevant enough that I'm counting it towards the hours funded by this grant), I've also made a fair
bit of progress.  Most significantly, I was able to complete the work to add fully immutable binding
to Rakudo.  Thanks to some helpful feedback from Vadim Belman, I also added significantly more
detailed error messages, which should help explain the nature of these binding to Rakoons who aren't
as used to programming with in an immutable style.  As discussed in my last grant report, being able
to immutably bind values to their names will mean that the persistent data structures implemented
for this grant will be truly immutable ‚Äì and thereby significantly easier to reason about.  This
work was merged in <a href="https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/pull/4536">rakudo#4536</a> and should be part of
the 2021.11 Rakudo release.</p>

<p>Additionally, I've been putting some thought into how Raku's notion of <a href="https://docs.raku.org/language/glossary#Value_type">value
types</a> fits with the persistent data structures
I'm implementing.  As I mentioned last month, one of the core motivations behind this grant proposal
is to provide deeply immutable types, so it's clear that the types I'm implementing will be value
types and thus will return a <a href="https://docs.raku.org/type/ValueObjAt">ValueObjAt</a> from their <code>WHICH</code>
method.  But what should the persistent types do when the user adds a non-value type?  I can see
three options:</p>

<ol>
<li>Throw an error/require the user to create a value type to pass in.  This is basically the approach taken by Elizabeth Mattijsen's  <a href="https://modules.raku.org/dist/ValueType:zef:zef:lizmat/">ValueType</a> module.</li>
<li>Recursively copy each non-value type into an equivalent value type when it's added to the persistent type ("copy-on-read").  This is straightforward for some types (an <code>Array</code> becomes a <code>List</code>) but might involve more metaprogramming trickery for others (especially user classes).
<ol>
<li>Store the non-value type if we can prove that no other part of the code has access to it, and only make a copy if we need to hand it out to someone (basically copy-on-write, with some slight tweaks).</li>
</ol></li>
</ol>

<p>Each of these has different pros and cons.  In particular, the first is the easiest to implement, the most verbose, and gives the user the most control over/awareness of the performance costs.  Conversely, the last is the most "magical" and the only one that risks introducing correctness bugs.  Additionally, there could be ways to combine different aspects of these three approaches ‚Äì for example, one combination of 1. and 2. would be to copy simple/built in types but to throw an error when passed a user type with a mutable field.  I'm currently leaning towards the copy-on-read option #2 as a reasonable middle ground, but it's definitely something I'd be interested in hearing other thoughts on.</p>

<p>November is already off to a good start, and I'm optimistic that I'll be able to make significant
progress on this grant before the end-of-year business (and exciting things like the <a href="https://github.com/Raku/advent/blob/master/raku-advent-2021/authors.md">Raku Advent
Calendar</a>!) start to eat
into my coding time.</p>

     <div class="card-body">       <div class="card-text"><p>Hi</p>
<p>The Perl Weekly newsletter is more than 10 years old and over those years we have witnessed a huge decline in the number and diversity of posts. There are still a few people who write about Perl regularly, The Weekly Challenge of Mohammad generates many posts, but in general we see fewer and fewer posts.</p>
<p>I wonder, do those people who used to write about Perl write about other technologies or have they just stopped? How come that so few people write about Perl? Are there no new things in Perl? Are there no new problems that one solves in Perl?</p>
<p>I know that writing about stuff is not the same thing as writing the stuff, but as many other people who write or teach will attest, the best way to improve your knowledge is to explain it. to explain it to live audience (at a Meetup) or to write about it in a blog post.</p>
<p>So how do you spend your free time? Do you write more code? Do you try to explain what you wrote, how you wrote and why? Or do you spend your time on some other activities? I, for examples started to read a lot more than I did in the recent years. And sure, I'll even share my recommendations with you. (See below.)</p>
<p>In any case enjoy your week!</p>       </div><!-- card-text -->     </div>

     <div class="card-body">       <div class="card-text"><p>Hi there</p>
<p>The headline of this week's newsletter is dedicated to all my German friends. However, the message is global "Good bye Hacktoberfest". I don't know the language, so I asked Google to help me. I am sure you all celebrated the month-long festival with loads of contributions to many opensource codebases. I can completely understand the feeling at the end of the month. Those who have participated and completed the challenge successfully i.e. submitted at least 4 eligible Pull Requests, should just relax and wait for their FREE gift. Please take November as a break as December will bring in another fun challenge i.e. <a href="https://24pullrequests.com">24 Pull Requests</a> for you.</p>
<p>Anything else to look forward to?</p>
<p>For me, there is another fun bit is the "Advent Calendar". There will be plenty of Advent Calendars available during the month. It is really hard to follow all of them. I came across something called, <a href="http://www.lenjaffe.com/AdventPlanet">Advent Planet</a>, which collects almost all popular Advent Calendars for us. Please do check it out, if you want a early peek. I really miss those days when I used to have time for such things. I have contributed to the Perl/Raku advent calendars in the past. If you have spare time and interest then please do get in touch with the person behind the project now and book your slot. There is one <a href="https://theweeklychallenge.org/blog/advent-calendar-2020">Advent Calendar</a> dedicated to the members of <a href="https://theweeklychallenge.org">The Weekly Challenge</a> only. I make sure the tradition continues every year. I hope everything goes as per the plan and we have another fun Advent Calendar by the dedicated members this year.</p>
<p>Start your week with yet another informative newsletter. You take care of yourself and your family. Keep a safe distance and stay safe,</p>       </div><!-- card-text -->     </div>

The same can be used to run any perl code on Bitbucket, but in our next step we'll see how to run the tests

<h3>Notes</h3>

<p>Instead of using a pre-computed list of Fibonacci numbers we generate them as needed. No
particular reason other than it's a little more fun, and also it allows us to flexibly 
allow for virtually any value for <code>$n</code>.</p>

<p>The sequences are determined by examining the Power Set of all possible sequences and
checking the sums.</p>

     <p>(from Jonathan Worthington)</p>

<p>During September, I completed the remaining hours on <a href="https://news.perlfoundation.org/post/grant_proposal_raku_dispatch_compiler_improvements">my current grant</a>.
The key aim of the grant - to bring my work on a new generalized dispatch mechanism to the point where it
could be merged and delivered to Raku users - has been achieved, the merge taking place on 29th September.
I wrote a <a href="https://6guts.wordpress.com/2021/09/29/the-new-moarvm-dispatch-mechanism-is-here/">blog post</a>
that provides some data on the improvements, as well as identifying future work that can build upon what
has been achieved thus far.</p>

<p>During September, working under the grant, I:</p>

<ul>
<li>Implemented specialization and inlining of dispatches that store resume initialization state, to allow
the dispatches to be resumed (for example, if <code>callsame</code> is used). This was a critical part of getting
back the level of inlining for method calls and multi dispatches that existed prior to this work, which
is a critical factor in Raku performance.</li>
<li>Implemented caller-side removal of <code>Scalar</code> containers, which in turn avoids various duplicate guards,
leading to much tighter code being produced after specialization and JIT compilation in many common
situations.</li>
<li>Fixed <code>Junction</code> multi-dispatch failover for the case where the <code>Junction</code> was in a named argument,
along the way tweaking the semantics to be more consistent with those of positional arguments (there
were some unintended discrepancies in the previous implementation).</li>
<li>Changed dispatch program compilation to not emit type guards when the types were already proven during
optimization, rather than adding them and relying on them to be optimized out later.</li>
<li>Reinstated all known missing optimizations from prior to the new dispatch work, and added JIT support
for various new operations introduced during the work.</li>
<li>Did various modifications to improve startup time, which has regressed. The new dispatch model has
many advantages, however does carry a higher warmup cost.</li>
<li>Fixed the profiler to work again in programs that use continuations, after changes to the continuation
representation as part of callstack changes.</li>
<li>Did numerous smaller fixes for bugs identified by <code>blin</code> (which runs the tests of all modules in the
ecosystem). In some cases where the modules relied on internals or unspecified behavior, I sent a PR
to the module instead.</li>
</ul>

<p>The time worked during September was 55 hours and 18 minutes, which was the remaining grant time
available.</p>

     <h2>Project title</h2>

<p>Optimizations building upon the new Raku dispatch mechanism</p>

<h2>Author</h2>

<p>Jonathan Worthington</p>

<h2>Synopsis</h2>

<p>Recently a new dispatch mechanism was merged into MoarVM, along with changes to
Rakudo to make use of it. This led to a number of <a href="https://6guts.wordpress.com/2021/09/29/the-new-moarvm-dispatch-mechanism-is-here/">performance improvements</a>
in the immediate, and incidentally fixed various long-standing bugs. This
is, however, just the start of what can be achieved with the new dispatch
architecture and the changes made to the runtime as part of implementing it.
This grant application requests funding to help deliver further improvements
unlocked by that work.</p>

<h2>How will your work specifically benefit the development of Raku?</h2>

<p>Raku performance has improved significantly since the initial release of the
language. This is thanks to a multi-faceted effort by many Raku contributors,
including putting more powerful optimizations in the runtime, the careful
optimization of the standard library, and developing better tooling for
analyzing performance. However, there is most certainly more to be done in
order that performance becomes a limiting factor for an ever smaller number
of developers considering using Raku.</p>

<p>This work will deliver further performance improvements for many Raku scripts
and applications. It is quite varied in nature, although primarily focuses on
improvements at the level of the language runtime (MoarVM), especially given
the fact that the current compiler frontend will ultimately be replaced thanks
to the ongoing RakuAST effort. Given I am also working on that, I'm well-placed
to avoid doing throwaway work.</p>

<h2>Project Details</h2>

<p>As with previous grants, I request an hourly rate, and propose a set of key
areas that I intend to work on, on the understanding that there may not be
time to complete all of them, or that studying profiler and compilation output
might reveal some more profitable improvements to work on (bigger performance
gains for less effort).</p>

<p>One key area of work is to reduce the cost of calls, which is relatively high.
A lot of this cost is hidden by MoarVM being able to inline (including multiple
levels deep) and, in the case a speculative optimization proves invalid, to
uninline. However, in anything except the tightest microbenchmark, we can't
just inline everything, and the calling cost thus needs to be reduced also. Of
note, I propose to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Reduce the cost of callframe setup by allocating space for registers and,
where possible, the lexical environment directly on the callstack rather
than as separate allocations. This should make every non-inlined call
faster.</li>
<li>Reorganize callframe entry to avoid repeated checks (for example, around
specialized/unspecialized, JIT compiled or not, etc.), perhaps getting rid
of many of the checks entirely in specialized code by compiling the steps
needed for callframe setup.</li>
<li>Find a different, and cheaper, way to handle <code>LEAVE</code> and similar phasers.
These are often required for reliable release of locks, but suffer from
relatively poor performance. Their potential presence also imposes a small
cost even on frames that do not rely upon them, which would be good to
eliminate.</li>
<li>Further rework callframe exit in order to make it cheaper. Of note, MoarVM
has a "special return" mechanism that is used internally to avoid nested
runloops in favor of a Continuation Passing Style approach, which currently
also imposes a small cost on every frame exit (checking if it is needed).
The callstack layout after the new dispatch mechanism work will allow
us to avoid this.</li>
</ul>

<p>Prior to working on the new dispatch mechanism, I started some work on partial
escape analysis, an analysis that allows for eliminating or delaying object
allocations. Raku makes heavy use of objects, which not only imposes the
direct cost of their allocation and later garbage collection, but also the
indirect cost of having further optimizations frustrated by not being able to
look "inside" the object. Some basic escape analysis has already been merged,
while further work was not completed, and in part blocked by things that have
now been resolved. I would like to return to this work, bringing it piecemeal
into the main branch. Of note, this will deliver:</p>

<ul>
<li>Support for transitive escape analysis, so we can avoid the allocation of
entire object graphs (for example, a Scalar container holding a Complex
could potentially elide both allocations).</li>
<li>Restructuring object creation. Today we often lazily allocate containers
for attributes, in part because we depend on it to know whether to apply
attribute default values. This creates complications for escape analysis,
as well as forcing initialization checks in quite a number of places.</li>
<li>Delayed materialization of allocations. For example, if an object is read
and written many times before it escapes (that is, returned or stored
somewhere we can't reason about), we can delay the allocation of the object,
treating its attributes as local variables up to that point. In some cases
the allocation may only happen in one branch (for example, in an exceptional
path), and so be possible to eliminate entirely in the common case.</li>
<li>Handling of <code>Int</code>s in scalar replacement (the process by which non-escaping
object's attributes are stored in VM registers). <code>Int</code> is important given how
common integer math is, but also challenging because of the potential big
integer upgrade. Special care will be needed to never leak memory that is
allocated for a big integer, even in the situations an enclosing object's
allocation is elided.</li>
</ul>

<p>Another area of work is to further improve or make further use of the new
dispatch mechanism. Of note:</p>

<ul>
<li>Apply the same caller-side decontainerization of <code>Scalar</code> containers approach
to also handle native references, so we can optimize their creation away in
many more cases. This should lead to performance improvements in code that
makes use of native types.</li>
<li>Provide a way to attach dispatch programs a level down the callstack, which
may turn a megamorphic program point into a monomorphic one. For example, at
the moment, when we have a <code>proto</code> with a complex body and a <code>{*}</code>, the cache
at the <code>{*}</code> will end up with entries for all argument types that are seen.
However, if we were to locate the cache in the caller of the <code>proto</code>, we'd
often end up with only a single entry. The same applies in a number of other
situations (for example, the dispatch resumption is currently inside of the
<code>callsame</code> sub, so we scale poorly in large applications that use <code>callsame</code>
in many different places).</li>
<li>Use the dispatch mechanism to better optimize use of the FALLBACK method</li>
<li>Use the dispatch mechanism to better optimize various forms of Raku type
check</li>
<li>In the case we have specializations available, fold the selection of a
specialization into the dispatch program, avoiding repeated guard checks</li>
</ul>

<h2>Project Schedule</h2>

<p>I would start immediately upon grant approval, and expect to give a minimum of
40 hours a month to the grant, however more should be possible most months.</p>

<h2>Bio</h2>

<p>I am the founder and architect of MoarVM, the most popular runtime for Raku users,
and the architect of the Rakudo compiler. I have contributed to the implementation
of numerous Raku language features, and played a key role in the design of the
concurrent and parallel aspects of the language. I hold a degree in Computer Science
from the University of Cambridge, and actively work in the field of developer
tooling and compilation.</p>

<h2>Amount requested</h2>

<p>200 hours * $60 USD / hour = $12,000 USD</p>

<h2>Part 1</h2>

<p><em>You are given an integer. Write a script find out the middle 3-digits of the given 
integer, if possible, otherwise show a sensible error message.</em></p>

<h3>Solution</h3>

<pre><code class="perl">

    return substr($i, $middle - 2, 3);
}

MAIN:{
    print middle_3(1234567) . "\n";
    print middle_3(-123) . "\n";
    print middle_3(1) . "\n";
    print middle_3(10) . "\n";
}
</code></pre>

<h3>Sample Run</h3>

<pre><code class="shell">
$ perl perl/ch-1.pl
345
123
too short
even number of digits
</code></pre>

<h3>Notes</h3>

<p>Maybe on of the more interesting things about this is just what we consider the middle 3.
Truly it only makes sense for an integer with an odd number of digits. But could we 
have stretched the idea to allow for an even number of digits, perhaps with some left 
padding? Perhaps, but here we don't. So all integers with only 1 or 2 digits are discarded
as are those with an even number of digits. Negative numbers are allowed, but we do not
consider the minus sign in determining the middle.</p>

<h2>Part 2</h2>

<p><em>You are given 7-characters alphanumeric SEDOL. Write a script to validate the given 
SEDOL. Print 1 if it is a valid SEDOL otherwise 0.</em></p>

sub is_sedol{
    my($sedol) = @_;
    my $base = substr($sedol, 0, 6);

    ##
    # check length

<h3>Notes</h3>

<p>The rules around SEDOLs are a bit more complex than this problem lets on. I won't recount
them all here, but suffice to say we are dealing with a quite idealized set of validations
here. For example, prior to 2004 only numerals were allowed, but since then letters are 
allowed. But only a numeral can follow a letter. Again, though, those are only rules that
apply for a certain time range.</p>

<p>Here we are just checking on length, whether or not the SEDOl contains all numerals and/or
(uppercase) letter, and the checksum validation.</p>
