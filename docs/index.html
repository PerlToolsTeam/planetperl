     <div class="card-body">       <div class="card-text"><p><a href="https://adventofcode.com/2021">Advent of Code</a> has started again and I'm again publishing my solutions to github (and probably also here). In the last two years I created on git repo for each year, but this year I changed my mind and want to have on repo containing a dir for each year.</p>

<p>Now I could just copy all the files into the <a href="https://github.com/domm/advent_of_code">new repo</a>, but that would lose the commit history. Which is unacceptable!</p>

<h4>The status quo ante</h4>

<pre><code>.
├── advent2019
│   ├── 01_1.pl
│   └── 01_2.pl
└── advent2020
    ├── 01_1.pl
    └── 01_2.pl</code></pre>

<h4>What I want</h4>

<pre><code>.
└─── advent_of_code
    ├── 2019
    │   ├── 01_1.pl
    │   └── 01_2.pl
    └── 2020
        ├── 01_1.pl
        └── 01_2.pl</code></pre>

<p>I know that git allows you to rewrite history and have once munged a repo using <code>git filter-branch</code> (to completely delete some files and commits). I of course forgot the details, but after a little bit of searching and trial and error I got it working!</p>

<h4>First, prepare the old repo</h4>

<p>To prevent merge conflicts later, I first move the code in the old repo from the root dir into a new dir, eg <code>2019</code></p>

<p>So this:</p>

<pre><code>.
└─── advent2019
    ├── 01_1.pl
    └── 01_2.pl</code></pre>

<p>Should look like this:</p>

<pre><code>.
└─── advent2019
    └─── 2019
        ├── 01_1.pl
        └── 01_2.pl</code></pre>

<p>I found <a href="https://gist.github.com/fabiomaggio/ce7ecd7dffd27b32a45325204288efce">this gist</a> very helpful, and adapted it to my needs:</p>

<pre><code>cd advent2019
mkdir 2019
git filter-branch --tree-filter 'mkdir -p /tmp/ad; mv * /tmp/ad; mkdir 2019; mv /tmp/ad/* 2019/' --tag-name-filter cat --prune-empty -- --all</code></pre>

<p>This uses <code>git filter-branch</code> to move the old code to a temp dir (<code>mv * /tmp/ad</code>) and then move it back to the new location (<code>mv /tmp/ad/* 2019/</code>), using some git magic to keep the history.</p>

<p>While I was at it, I also removed some of the AdventOfCode input files which I had commited (but which we should not commit):</p>

<pre><code>git filter-branch -f --tree-filter 'rm -f 2019/*.data' HEAD</code></pre>

<h4>Second, import the repo</h4>

<p>Now I can merge the old repo into my new unified repo. This time this <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/6004865">StackOverflow comment</a> pointed me in the right direction. The basic idea is to add the old repo as a new remote, fetch the commits, and then merge them using <code>--allow-unrelated-histories</code></p>

<pre><code>cd advent_of_code
git remote add old19 ../advent2019/
git fetch old19
git merge --allow-unrelated-histories old19/master
git remote remove old19</code></pre>

<p>And then push, and we're done and have a nice unified repo:</p>

<pre><code>~/perl/advent_of_code$ tree
.
├── 2019
│   ├── 01_1.pl
│   ├── 01_2.pl
├── 2020
│   ├── 01_1.pl
│   ├── 01_2.pl
│   ├── 01_2_golf.pl
├── 2021
│   ├── 01_1.pl
│   ├── 01_1_golf.pl
│   └── 01_2.pl
└── README.md</code></pre>

<p>And the history was preserved:</p>

<pre><code>~/perl/advent_of_code$ git log 2019/24_1.pl
commit dbaf0bc1df645bda61ec5cf7e623d478a179947e
Author: Thomas Klausner &lt;domm@plix.at&gt;
Date:   Fri Dec 27 10:10:10 2019 +0100

    no need to keep a map around, the rating is unique per map</code></pre>

<p>Win!</p>

<p>Next steps: Fix all links pointing to the old repos to point to the new location, and maybe archive / delete the github repos (and/or have them redirect to the new unified repo)</p>       </div><!-- card-text -->     </div>

<p>If you want to start reading from the beginning. Check out the <a href="https://dev.to/ansigameengine/developing-a-game-engine-with-perl-3b8">first article in this series</a></p>

<p>Continuing on with the <a href="https://dev.to/ansigameengine/developing-a-game-engine-with-perl-part-4-uefi-vs-opensuse-installer-5e1c">last article</a> let's talk about changing system architecture and how that can affect Perl code, specifically <a href="https://perldoc.perl.org/Storable">Storable</a>.</p>

<ul>
<li>Mouse Input Support</li>
<li>Hardware Failure</li>
<li>Server Upgrade</li>
<li>UEFI vs OpenSuSE Installer</li>
<li><strong>32bit -&gt; 64bit &amp; Perl's Storable</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>After the old server had <a href="https://dev.to/ansigameengine/developing-a-game-engine-with-perl-part-3-hardware-failure-server-upgrade-on1">HDD failures</a> and finally <a href="https://dev.to/ansigameengine/developing-a-game-engine-with-perl-part-4-uefi-vs-opensuse-installer-5e1c">managing to upgrade</a> to the new server, I eagerly began getting all the services and software installed to test the engine on new hardware. I was quickly meet with an error I have never seen before.</p>

<p><code>Byte order is not compatible at /usr/lib/perl5/5.34.0/x86_64-linux-thread-multi/Storable.pm</code></p>

<p>After doing some quick reading, I came to understand that Perl uses architecture specific ways to save content to files when using Storable. Specifically if you use <code>lock_store</code> and <code>store</code>. These are part of Perl's core system and what I use throughout the engine for working with the file structure.</p>

<p>I had to carefully re-read the perldoc's to discover that you can avoid architecture incompatibility by simply using <code>nstore</code> and <code>lock_nstore</code> The method you use for retrieving the stored files doesn't matter, only when storing the data into files does it matter.</p>

<p>I tried to find ways of being able to convert the stored files from 32bit architecture to 64bit, but ultimately the only real option was to use the old server to re-store the files with lock_nstore.</p>

<p>Luckily the old PC was still working, and I was able to modify the code and re-store all the files. The change and usage was simple:</p>

<p>I had to change my use statement from:<br>
<code>use Storable qw(lock_store lock_retrieve);</code><br>
to<br>
<code>use Storable qw(lock_nstore lock_retrieve)</code></p>

<p>And to re-store I changed my code from this:<br>
<code>lock_store($data_ref, $dir_location);</code><br>
to<br>
<code>lock_nstore($data_ref, $dir_location);</code></p>

<p>Have you ever had to write code for architecture compatibility? Or fix code migrated from one architecture to another? What do you prefer for storing data to files in Perl?</p>

  A small computer and almost destroying it...
</h2>

<p>The last server's hard drive died, and I happen to have this old, but better, computer. It was in pieces, sitting in a box for a long time. Putting it back together was not easy. This <a href="https://www.acer.com/ac/en/US/content/support-product/3916?b=1&amp;pn=DT.SLQAA.001">Aspire X1470</a> is a small form factor design, meaning there is no room to spare. Also meaning if your computer has been sitting around in a box, in pieces for a long time, and its' frame gets bent... well that means it's going to be very difficult to get it back together. I managed to rip off a chip heatsink in the process. I tell ya, my stomach turned right over... but luckily it went back on and seems to be holding and working fine.</p>

<h2>
  <a href="#uefi-vs-opensuse-installer">
  </a>
  UEFI vs OpenSuSE Installer
</h2>

<p>This is where things get interesting. After finally getting the computer together, I downloaded the OpenSuSE ISO for 64bit. I went with <a href="https://get.opensuse.org/tumbleweed">Tumbleweed</a> again. It worked well with the last server, so I'll just go with what I know. Tumbleweed is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_release">rolling release linux</a>, which means I shouldn't have to reinstall when a new version is released and I should still stay up to date. I created a <a href="https://askubuntu.com/questions/1335903/make-a-full-bootable-usb-stick-with-gnome-disk-utility">bootable USB from ISO in Ubuntu 20.04</a> (My Desktop). Booted the new computer, installed OpenSuSE, and was happy... until I tried to reboot.</p>

<p>When I rebooted, I pulled out the USB stick and the BIOS said no boot drives. I knew of UEFI, and started reading. I found that in /boot/efi/ there was no EFI directory. If you don't know anything about UEFI (No worries, neither do I) ..apparently there is supposed to be a Fat32 partition marked as type EFI. The BIOS checks for this location and attempts to load the OS this way as apposed to using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_boot_record">MBR</a> for booting like in the old days. </p>

<p>Here is what it looks like now in the server using <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/fdisk.8.html">fdisk</a> to look at the partitions and <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/1/tree">tree</a> to look at the directory structure:<br>

</code></pre>

</div>



<p>You may need to scroll right to see the partition type EFI.</p>

<p>Well, this is what was <strong>NOT</strong> happening when I installed. I tried several different ways to get it to do an EFI install, but it kept doing it MBR style. The difficult thing is I didn't know what to ask google, and every time I had to try a new install method, it took about an hour to do the install, just to check and find out that it was wrong.</p>

<p>I knew that the installer wasn't loading in EFI mode and was running in legacy mode, but I didn't know how to switch it manually, and why it was choosing legacy in the first place. I checked the BIOS for booting options, and there just wasn't anything that would force it to boot from a HDD's MBR. I also didn't want to do a firmware update, I just wanted to code and get this install done.</p>

<p>Finally.... the answer was the BIOS just sucks. For some reason it prioritizes legacy mode on USB booting and I could only get it to chose an EFI boot from USB by manually loading it in the boot menu with F12. Allowing it to choose the USB for booting always resulted in legacy mode, regardless of the settings specified in the BIOS. Of course OpenSuSE's installer will not allow you to switch to EFI if you are in legacy mode. Also it does not make it obvious for the uninitiated to know that it is in legacy (MBR) mode. </p>

<p>I managed to find an obscure article that said <strong><code>"If you see the options for pressing F keys at the bottom of the install screen, then it's legacy mode"</code></strong> That one little piece of information is all I needed to understand what was happening. I saw that every time I booted into the OpenSuSE installer there were F key options at the bottom. That's when I realized that the BIOS wasn't booting from the USB's EFI partition. After realizing this, I used a manual BIOS boot, picked the correct USB boot drive (of course the BIOS displays both EFI and Legacy USB boot drives with the same name) I got the correct install screen, the EFI boot options were all there. The install went really easy at this point and is up and running now for a few days with no issues.</p>

<p>Have you ever worked with small form factor computers? What sort of disaster stories, or success stories have you had? Also what about installing an OS with UEFI vs MBR, what sort of experiences have you had?</p>

<p>My Dev/Test server's hard drive is going bad and I need to deal with this ASAP! It's one of those <a href="https://www.acer.com/ac/en/ID/content/support-product/4000;-;">all in one PC's Acer makes</a> You can see it far right, tucked behind the laptops in this pic of my setup.</p>

<p><a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--gh0StCVz--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/8t6ca8pe8d1sggz4kj1a.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--gh0StCVz--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/8t6ca8pe8d1sggz4kj1a.jpg" alt="Image description" width="880" height="880"></a></p>

<p>It's been a while since I've had to look at system logs in <a href="https://www.opensuse.org/">Linux OpenSuSE</a>. I used to remember just doing a <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/tail.1.html">tail -f /var/log/messages</a> or what ever log file you wanted to watch. I guess at some point since then they switched to using systemd journal service and you can now view everything using <a href="https://documentation.suse.com/es-es/sles/15-SP1/html/SLES-all/cha-journalctl.html">journalctl</a></p>

<p>This is actually OK. I back up my code, so I'm not worried about data loss. Aaaaand... I just so happen to have another Acer computer that has been sitting in a cardboard box in pieces for a long time. Buuut... this other computer is much better spec'd. </p>

<p>Here you can see a <a href="https://github.com/dylanaraps/neofetch">neofetch</a> comparison of the 2 servers side by side. Left is the "new" server, right is the old server with the bad HDD.</p>

<p><a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--j2dXVXrY--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/f70tbyuqndxq3gy3t0p9.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--j2dXVXrY--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/f70tbyuqndxq3gy3t0p9.jpg" alt="Image description" width="688" height="259"></a></p>

<p><strong>Notable upgrades:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>32bit -&gt; 64bit Architecture</li>
<li>2 Core -&gt; 4 Core CPU</li>
<li>4 GB -&gt; 6 GB RAM</li>
<li>A Very Slow 1 TB -&gt; Much Faster 1.5 TB HDD</li>
</ul>

<p>I'm excited mainly for the extra core count for <a href="https://perldoc.perl.org/functions/fork">forking</a> and the working hard drive, that is exceptionally faster.</p>

<p>Running an <a href="http://manpages.org/fio">fio test</a> shows dramatic differences in results.</p>

<p><code>fio --name=randwrite --ioengine=libaio --iodepth=1 --rw=randwrite --bs=4k --direct=0 --size=512M --numjobs=4 --runtime=240 --group_reporting</code></p>

<p>Old server write speeds are around 6789kB/s and took a few minutes to run. The new server performs @ 109MB/s and finished the test in a few seconds. I'd say we should see a huge performance increase, and we do! </p>

<p>The engine can do a lot of writing to the hard drive at times, and I used to see the lag, now... no lag from the hard drive! Nice and quick! Also no bad sectors.</p>

<p>I've <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Block/References/samplefiocommandslinux.htm">read somewhere</a> that you may not want to perform randwrite against a device that is in use... So, be careful. I did it with no apparent problems, and the bad sectors were well before ever running the fio command. </p>

<p>Let me know if you have any experience with hard drive failure diagnosing and testing write speeds with fio.</p>

<p>If you have any suggestions or comments please share constructively. Also please visit our social media pages for lots of fun videos and pictures showing the game engine in action. </p>

     <div class="card-body">       <div class="card-text"><p>Over the past two years, I’ve gotten back into playing <a href="https://dnd.wizards.com/">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a>, the famous tabletop fantasy role-playing game. As a software developer and musician, one of my favorite character classes to play is the <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/classes/bard">bard</a>, a magical and inspiring performer or wordsmith. The list of basic bardic spells includes <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/vicious-mockery">Vicious Mockery</a>, enchanting verbal barbs that have the power to psychically damage and disadvantage an opponent <em>even if they don’t understand the words</em>. (Can you see why this is so appealing to a coder?)</p>

<p>Mocking has a role to play in software testing as well, in the form of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mock_object">mock objects</a> that simulate parts of a system that are too brittle, too slow, too complicated, or otherwise too finicky to use in reality. They enable discrete <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_testing">unit testing</a> without relying on dependencies external to the code being tested. Mocks are great for databases, web services, or other network resources where the goal is to test what you wrote, not what’s out in “the cloud” somewhere.</p>

<p>Speaking of web services and mocking, one of my favorites is the long-running <a href="https://foaas.com/">FOAAS</a> (link has language not safe for work), a surprisingly expansive <a href="https://restfulapi.net/">RESTful</a> insult service. There’s a corresponding <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/WebService::FOAAS">Perl client API</a>, of course, but what I was missing was a handy Perl script to call that API from the terminal command line. So I wrote the following over <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thanksgiving_(United_States)">Thanksgiving</a> break, trying to keep it simple while also showing the basics of mocking such an API. It also demonstrates some newer Perl syntax and testing techniques as well as <a href="https://briandfoy.github.io/">brian d foy</a>’s <a href="https://perlmaven.com/modulino-both-script-and-module">modulino</a> concept from <em><a href="https://www.masteringperl.org/">Mastering Perl</a> (second edition, 2014)</em> that marries script and module into a self-contained <a href="https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Executable_library">executable library</a>.<br>

<p>Let’s walk through the code above.</p>

<h2>
  <a href="#preliminaries">
  </a>
  Preliminaries
</h2>

<p>First, there’s a generic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebang_(Unix)">shebang line</a> to indicate that Unix and Linux systems should use the <code>perl</code> executable found in the user’s PATH via the <code>env</code> command. I declare a package name (<a href="https://phoenixtrap.com/2021/04/13/avoid-cpan-conflicts-in-your-personal-perl-modules/">in the Local:: namespace</a>) so as not to pollute the default <code>main</code> package of other scripts that might want to <code>require</code> this as a module. Then I use the <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Test2::V0">Test2::V0 bundle</a> from <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Test2::Suite">Test2::Suite</a> since the embedded testing code uses many of its functions. This also has the side effect of enabling the <a href="https://perldoc.perl.org/strict">strict</a>, <a href="https://perldoc.perl.org/warnings">warnings</a>, and <a href="https://perldoc.perl.org/utf8">utf8</a> pragmas, so there’s no need to explicitly <code>use</code> them here.</p>

<p>(Why <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Test2">Test2</a> instead of <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Test::More">Test::More</a> and its derivatives and add-ons? Both are <a href="https://metacpan.org/author/EXODIST">maintained by the same author</a>, who recommends the former. I’m seeing more and more modules using it, so I thought this would be a great opportunity to learn.)</p>

<p>I then declare all the new-ish Perl features I’d like to use that need to be explicitly enabled so as not to sacrifice <a href="https://perldoc.perl.org/perlpolicy#BACKWARD-COMPATIBILITY-AND-DEPRECATION">backward compatibility</a> with older versions of Perl 5. As of this writing, some of these features (the <a href="https://perldoc.perl.org/perlop#Class-Instance-Operator"><code>isa</code> class instance operator</a>, named argument <a href="https://perldoc.perl.org/perlsub#Signatures">subroutine signatures</a>, and <a href="https://perldoc.perl.org/perlsyn#Try-Catch-Exception-Handling"><code>try</code>/<code>catch</code> exception handling</a> syntax) are considered <a href="https://perldoc.perl.org/experimental"><code>experimental</code></a>, with the latter enabled in older versions of Perl via the <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Feature::Compat::Try">Feature::Compat::Try</a> module. The friendlier <a href="https://perldoc.pl/perlref#Postfix-Dereference-Syntax">postfix dereferencing</a> syntax was <a href="https://perldoc.perl.org/perl5240delta#Postfix-dereferencing-is-no-longer-experimental">mainlined in Perl version 5.24</a>, but versions 5.20 and 5.22 still need it experimental. Finally, I <code>use Syntax::Construct</code> to announce the <code>/r</code> flag for non-destructive regular expression <a href="https://perldoc.perl.org/perlop#s/PATTERN/REPLACEMENT/msixpodualngcer">text substitutions</a> <a href="https://perldoc.perl.org/perl5140delta#Non-destructive-substitution">introduced in version 5.14</a>.</p>

<p>Next, I bring in the aforementioned FOAAS Perl API without importing any of its functions, <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Package::Stash">Package::Stash</a> to make <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaprogramming">metaprogramming</a> easier, and a couple of <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Exception::Class">exception classes</a> so that the command line function and other consumers might better tell what caused a failure. In preparation for the methods below dynamically discovering what functions are provided by <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/WebService::FOAAS">WebService::FOAAS</a>, I <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Package::Stash#new-%24package_name">gather up</a> its symbol table (or stash) into the <code>$foaas</code> variable.</p>

<p>The next block determines how, if at all, I’m going to run the code as a script. If the <code>CPANTEST</code> environment variable is set, I’ll call the <code>test</code> class method <code>sub</code>, but if there’s no subroutine <a href="https://perldoc.perl.org/functions/caller">calling</a> me I’ll execute the <code>run</code> class method. Either will receive the <a href="https://perldoc.perl.org/variables/@ARGV">command line arguments from <code>@ARGV</code></a>. If neither of these conditions is true, do nothing; the rest of the code is method declarations.</p>

<h2>
  <a href="#modulino-methods-metaprogramming-and-exceptions">
  </a>
  Modulino methods, metaprogramming, and exceptions
</h2>

<p>The first of these is the <code>run</code> method. It’s a thin wrapper around the <code>call_method</code> class method detailed below, either outputting its result or <code>die</code>ing with an appropriate error depending on the class of exception thrown. Although I chose not to write tests for this output, future tests might call this method and catch these rethrown exceptions to match against them. The messages end with a <code>\n</code> newline character so <code>die</code> knows not to append the current script line number.</p>

<p>Next is a utility method called <code>methods</code> that uses Package::Stash’s <code>list_all_symbols</code> to retrieve the names of all named <code>CODE</code> blocks (i.e., <code>sub</code>s) from WebService::FOAAS’s symbol table. Reading from right to left, these are then filtered with <code>grep</code> to only find those <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/WebService::FOAAS#AVAILABLE-METHODS">beginning in <code>foaas_</code></a> and then transformed with <code>map</code> to remove that prefix. The list is then <code>sort</code>ed and stored in a <code>state</code> variable and returned so it need not be initialized again.</p>

<p>(As an aside, although <code>perlcritic</code> sternly warns against it I’ve chosen the expression forms of <code>grep</code> and <code>map</code> here over their <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Perl::Critic::Policy::BuiltinFunctions::RequireBlockGrep">block</a> <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Perl::Critic::Policy::BuiltinFunctions::RequireBlockMap">forms</a> for simplicity’s sake. It’s OK to <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Perl::Critic#BENDING-THE-RULES">bend the rules</a> if you have a good reason.)</p>

<p><code>sub call_method</code> is where the real action takes place. Its parameters are the class that called it, the name of a FOAAS <code>$method</code> (defaulted to the empty string), and an array of optional arguments in <code>@args</code>. I build a hash or associative array from the earlier <code>methods</code> method which I then use to see if the passed method name is one I know about. If not, I throw a <code>NoMethodException</code> using the <code>throw_no_method</code> alias function <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Exception::Class#DECLARING-EXCEPTION-CLASSES">created when I used Exception::Class</a> at the beginning. Using a function instead of <code>NoMethodException-&gt;throw()</code> means that it’s checked at compile time rather than runtime, catching typos.</p>

<p>I get the subroutine (denoted by a <code>&amp;</code> sigil) named by <code>$method</code> from the <code>$foaas</code> stash and pass it any further received arguments from <code>@args</code>. If that WebService::FOAAS subroutine throws an exception it’ll be caught and re-thrown as a <code>ServiceException</code>; otherwise <code>call_method</code> returns the result. It’s up to the caller to determine what, if anything, to do with that result or any thrown exceptions.</p>

<h2>
  <a href="#testing-the-modulino-with-mocks">
  </a>
  Testing the modulino with mocks
</h2>

<p>This is where I start using those <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Test2::Suite#Test2::V#">Test2::Suite tools</a> I mentioned at the beginning. The <code>test</code> class method starts by building a filtered list of all <code>sub</code>s beginning with <code>_test_</code> in the current class, much like <code>methods</code> did above with WebService::FOAAS. I then loop through that list of <code>sub</code>s, running each as a <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Test2::V0#SUBTEST"><code>subtest</code></a> containing a class method with any exceptions <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Test2::Tools::Basic#diag(@messages)">reported as diagnostics</a>.</p>

<p>The rest of the modulino is subtest methods, starting with a simple <code>_test_can</code> sanity check for the public methods in the class. Following that is <code>_test_methods</code>, which starts by <code>mock</code>ing the WebService::FOAAS package and telling Test2::Mock I want to <code>track</code> any added, overridden, or set <code>sub</code>s. I then loop through all the method names returned by the <code>methods</code> class method, <code>override</code>ing each one to return a simple true value. I then test passing those names to <code>call_method</code> and use the hash reference returned by <code>sub_tracking</code> to check that the overridden <code>sub</code> was called. This seems a lot simpler than the <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Test::Builder">Test::Builder</a>-based mocking libraries I’ve tried like <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Test::MockModule">Test::MockModule</a> and <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Test::MockObject">Test::MockObject</a>.</p>

<p><code>_test_service_failure</code> acts in much the same way, checking that <code>call_method</code> correctly throws <code>ServiceException</code>s if the wrapped WebService::FOAAS function <code>die</code>s. The main difference is that the mocked WebService::FOAAS <code>sub</code>s are now overridden with a code reference (<code>sub { die 'mocked' }</code>), which <code>call_method</code> uses to populate the rethrown <code>ServiceException</code>’s <code>error</code> field.</p>

<h2>
  <a href="#wrapping-up">
  </a>
  Wrapping up
</h2>

<p>With luck, this article has given you some ideas, whether it’s in making scripts (perhaps legacy code) testable to improve them, or writing better unit tests that mock dependencies, or delving a little into metaprogramming so you can dynamically support and test new features of said dependencies. I hope you haven’t come away too offended, at least. Let me know in the comments what you think.</p>

        <p><big><strong>Perl? What... really?</strong></big></p>

<p>To most in the know, coding a game engine with Perl would be a surprise. I've certainly been asked, "<em>Why Perl?</em>". You see, unlike C++, C#, Java and others, which are well established languages in game engine design, Perl is not (well) known for it's role in the development of games. Especially not as a game engine language. You are much more likely to see Perl managing the network infrastructure for the gaming industry then you are to see it powering your favourite video games.</p>

<p><big><strong>So why use Perl then?</strong></big></p>

<p>Because It's what I know. It's that simple. I've spent many years using Perl to solve many problems throughout my career. I've been fortunate to write Perl code that interacts with a wide variety of hardware, Linux servers and network services. But never a game engine. So I answer "<em>Why Perl?</em>" with "<em>Why not Perl?</em>"</p>

<p><big><strong>Why design another game engine? Why not just use an existing engine to make games?</strong></big></p>

<p>I had to ask myself these questions early on. You see, I've always wanted to create games and for most of my life I've been tinkering with other peoples game code. </p>

<p>Do you remember <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gorillas_(video_game)">Gorillas</a>? The QuickBASIC game that came installed on Dos back in the early 90's.  I sure do. That was one of the first memories I have opening up and messing around with game code. </p>

<p>What about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulletin_board_system">Bulletin Board Systems</a>? The Internet before the Internet, using 16 colour ANSI graphics with a 80x25 "Pixel" resolution. That's OK if you've never heard of a BBS. Or ANSI graphics. But for me, that was my first introduction to hosting a game server, and also where I wrote my first online game. I got to see people logging onto my server and playing my door game for the first time. They are called door games for BBS systems, don't ask me why. I coded it in QuickBASIC (pre Perl days for me) and it ran on my <a href="https://renegadebbs.info/">Renegade BBS</a> I was running my own multi-node dial-up BBS with 14.4Kbps modems. That's right, online gaming at 14.4 kbit/s. Can you imagine the ping times!</p>

<p>One of the things about me is that I prefer to do things myself if I can. This extends into my programming life as well. So fast forward many years later, me still tinkering in various game code / modding along the way, using Perl extensively in my career, I came to the conclusion that I was just gonna do it. I was going to make my own game (engine). But I didn't go to school for it and have little to no actual knowledge in this field. Sure I've written lots of Perl code, but I don't know much more than a casual hobbyist at best when it comes to writing a game. Buuuut.... I <strong>DO</strong> know how to code in Perl, I <strong>DO</strong> know a little bit about ANSI Graphics and I <strong>DO</strong> know about telnet. That's the Language, The graphics (and audio, ANSI codes can be used for producing sounds) and I can make it online play for Windows, Mac and Linux using <a href="https://syncterm.bbsdev.net/">SyncTERM</a> as the telnet ANSI client and Linux <a href="https://www.opensuse.org/">OpenSUSE</a> as the server.</p>

<p><big><strong>And that's where it all begins. </strong></big></p>

<p>I know just enough to get started. So I did, and I've made great progress, but I still have much much more to do. Which is why I decided to create a blog, to share what I learn along the way as I journey for the first time in making <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ANSIGameEngine">ANSI Game Engine</a></p>

<p>If you have any suggestions or comments please share constructively. Also please visit our social media pages for lots of fun videos and pictures showing the game engine in action. </p>

<p>Did you participate in <strong>Hacktoberfest 2021</strong>?</p>
<p>If not then you have one more chance to participate in the global event <a href="https://24pullrequests.com">24 Pull Requests</a>. Participation is simple, you just have to submit one pull request each day between 1st Dec 2021 and 24th Dec 2021. It is one of my favourite events. I have participated in the event each year, without a break, since 2015. I was introduced to it by <a href="http://blogs.perl.org/users/neilb/2015/11/24-pull-requests.html">Neil Bowers</a>. Last year I was going through rough patch so, unfortunately, I had to skip it. My best performance was in the year 2018 when I contributed <strong>125 pull requests</strong> in the first 24 days of December. If I am not mistaken then the <strong>24 Pull Requests</strong> event is little more relaxed as compare to <strong>Hacktoberfest</strong>. You don't have to submit a pull request every day. Instead, you can submit in bulk one day and then take a break. However, make sure you have submitted at least 24 pull requests by the end of play on 24th December.</p>
<p>Happy Hacking !!!</p>
<p>Do you follow the much-discussed <strong>Perl</strong> project <strong>Corinna</strong>?</p>
<p>The project is run by <strong>Curtis</strong> and his dedicated team of experts. I came across a <a href="https://ovid.github.io/articles/why-is-perl-not-putting-moose-in-the-core.html">blog post</a> by <strong>Curtis</strong> talking about "<strong>Why is Perl not putting Moose in the core?</strong>" There is a bold statement in the post in response to the question "<strong>What’s an Object in Perl?</strong>" and it is "<strong>Perl knows nothing about OOP. It doesn’t know what objects are.</strong>"</p>
<p><strong>Curtis</strong> doesn't say things without a reason. Please read the full blog post for more informations. I am one of the biggest followers of <strong>Curtis</strong> and never miss his posts.</p>
<p>If you remember, I mentioned <strong>Advent Calendars</strong> in the editorial of the weekly newsletter edition <a href="https://www.perlweekly.com/archive/536.html">#536</a>. Ever since then, I have noticed lots of activities in the <strong>Perl</strong> and <strong>Raku</strong> communities about <strong>Advent Calendars</strong>. I am confident this year we are going to have another fun filled <strong>Advent Calendar</strong>.</p>
<p>Last but not least, <a href="https://theweeklychallenge.org">The Weekly Challenge</a> (also known as <strong>Perl Weekly Challenge</strong>) is going to complete <strong>1000 days</strong> on <strong>18th December 2021</strong>.

<h3>Add Binary in Raku</h3>

<p>In Raku, we simply convert the binary strings to regular integers, using the <a href="https://docs.raku.org/routine/parse-base">parse-base</a> method, add these integers with normal addition, and convert the result back to a binary string with the <a href="https://docs.raku.org/routine/base">base</a> built-in method.</p>

<pre><code>use v6;

sub add-bin ($a, $b) {
    ($a.Str.parse-base(2) + $b.Str.parse-base(2)).base(2);
}
for (11, 1), (101, 1), (100, 11), (1011,11) -&gt; $test {
    say "$test\t=&gt; ", add-bin $test[0], $test[1];
}
</code></pre>

<p>This scipt displays the following output:</p>

<pre><code>$ raku ./add-binary.raku
11 1    =&gt; 100
101 1   =&gt; 110
100 11  =&gt; 111
</code></pre>

<h3>Add Binary in Perl</h3>

<p>In Perl, we implemented manually an <code>add_bin</code> subroutine to perform direct addition of decimal-coded binary numbers.</p>

<pre><code>use strict;
use warnings;
use feature "say";

sub add_bin {
    my ($c, $d) = @_;
    ($d, $c) = ($c, $d) if $d &gt; $c;
    my $result = "";
    my @c = reverse split //, $c;
    my @d = reverse split //, $d;
    my $carry = 0;   # carry over
    for my $i (0 .. $#c){
        my $e = $d[$i] // 0;
        my $t = $c[$i] + $e + $carry;
        $result .= $t and $carry = 0 if $t &lt;= 1;
        if ($t == 2) {
            $result .= 0;
            $carry = 1;
        } elsif ($t == 3) {
            $result .= 1;
            $carry = 1;
        }
    }
    $result .= ($carry == 0 ? '' : $carry == 1 ? 1 : '01');
    return scalar reverse $result;
}
for my $test ( [11, 1], [101, 1], [100, 11], [100, 100], [1011, 11]) {
    say "@$test\t=&gt; ", add_bin @$test;
}
</code></pre>

<p>This script displays the following output:</p>

<pre><code>$ perl  ./add-binary.pl
11 1    =&gt; 100
101 1   =&gt; 110
100 11  =&gt; 111
100 100 =&gt; 1000
1011 11 =&gt; 1110

        <p>These are some answers to the Week 139 of the <a href="https://perlweeklychallenge.org/blog/perl-weekly-challenge-140/">Perl Weekly Challenge</a> organized by <a href="http://blogs.perl.org/users/mohammad_s_anwar/">Mohammad S. Anwar</a>.</p>

<h2>Task 1: Add Binary</h2>

<p>This task was covered in the following blog post: http://blogs.perl.org/users/laurent_r/2021/11/perl-weekly-challenge-140-add-binary.html.</p>

<h2>Task 2: Multiplication Table</h2>

<p><em>You are given 3 positive integers, <code>$i</code>, <code>$j</code> and <code>$k</code>.</em></p>

<p><em>Write a script to print the <code>$kth</code> element in the sorted multiplication table of <code>$i</code> and <code>$j</code>.</em></p>

<p><em>Example 1:</em></p>

<pre><code>Input: $i = 2; $j = 3; $k = 4
Output: 3

Since the multiplication of 2 x 3 is as below:

    1 2 3
    2 4 6

The sorted multiplication table:

    1 2 2 3 4 6

Now the 4th element in the table is "3".
</code></pre>

<p><em>Example 2:</em></p>

<pre><code>Input: $i = 3; $j = 3; $k = 6
Output: 4

Since the multiplication of 3 x 3 is as below:

    1 2 3
    2 4 6
    3 6 9

The sorted multiplication table:

    1 2 2 3 3 4 6 6 9

Now the 6th element in the table is "4".
</code></pre>

<h3>Multiplication Table in Raku</h3>

<p>We use the built-in infix <code>X</code> <a href="https://docs.raku.org/routine/X">cross-product</a> operator to create all combinations from each range, and combine it with the <code>*</code> multiplication operators to obtain all the products of the multiplication table. Then, we simply sort the values obtained and pick the right one (at index <code>$k - 1</code>). In Raku, we can chain all these operations in just one code-line:</p>

<pre><code>use v6;

sub mult-table (UInt $i, UInt $j, UInt $k) {
    say (sort 1..$i X* 1..$j)[$k - 1]
}
for (2, 3, 4), (3, 3, 6) -&gt; $a, $b, $c {
    mult-table $a, $b, $c;
}
</code></pre>

<p>This script displays the following output:</p>

<pre><code>raku ./mult-table.raku
3
4
</code></pre>

<h3>Multiplication Table in Perl</h3>

<p>Since we don&#8217;t have the cross-product operator in Perl, we will simply use two nested <code>for</code> loops to compute the products and store them in the <code>@products</code> array. Then, we sort the values obtained and pick the right one (at index <code>$k - 1</code>).</p>

<pre><code>use strict;
use warnings;
use feature "say";

sub mult_table {
    my ($c, $d, $k) = @{$_[0]};
    my @products;
    for my $i (1..$c) {
        for my $j (1..$d) {
            push @products, $i * $j;
        }
    }
    say +(sort {$a &lt;=&gt; $b} @products)[$k - 1];

}
for my $test ([2, 3, 4], [3, 3, 6]) {
    mult_table $test;
}
</code></pre>

<p>This script displays the following output:</p>

<pre><code>$ perl mult-table.pl
3
4
</code></pre>

<h2>Part 1</h2>

<p><em>You are given two decimal-coded binary numbers, $a and $b. Write a script to simulate the

<h3>Solution</h3>

<pre><code class="perl">
use strict;
use warnings;
sub add_binary{
    my($x, $y) = @_;
    my $sum = ""; 
    my @a = reverse(split(//, $x));

            $sum = "1$sum", $carry = 0 if $d0 == 0 && $d1 == 0 && $carry == 1; 
            $sum = "0$sum", $carry = 1 if $d0 == 1 && $d1 == 0 && $carry == 1;

        } 
        else{
            $sum = "0$sum", $carry = 1, next if $d0 == 1 && $carry == 1;

        }  
    } 
    $sum = "$carry$sum" if $carry == 1;  
    return $sum; 
}

MAIN:{
    print add_binary(11, 1) . "\n"; 
    print add_binary(101, 1) . "\n"; 
    print add_binary(100, 11) . "\n"; 
}
</code></pre>

<h3>Sample Run</h3>

<pre><code class="shell">
$ perl perl/ch-1.pl
100
110
111
</code></pre>

<h3>Notes</h3>

<p>I have an unusual fondness for Perl's right hand conditional. But that is pretty obvious 
from the way I wrote this, right? </p>

<h2>Part 2</h2>

<p><em>You are given 3 positive integers, $i, $j and $k. Write a script to print the $kth 
element in the sorted multiplication table of $i and $j.</em></p>

<h3>Solution</h3>

<pre><code class="perl">
use strict;
use warnings;
sub nth_from_table{
    my($i, $j, $k) = @_;
    my @table;
    for my $x (1 .. $i){
        for my $y (1 .. $j){
            push @table, $x * $y; 
        }  
    }  
    return (sort {$a <=> $b} @table)[$k - 1];   
} 

MAIN:{
    print nth_from_table(2, 3, 4) . "\n";  
    print nth_from_table(3, 3, 6) . "\n";  
} 
</code></pre>

<h3>Sample Run</h3>

<pre><code class="shell">
$ perl perl/ch-2.pl 
3
4
</code></pre>

<h3>Notes</h3>

<p>Full Disclosure: At first I wanted to do this in some convoluted way for fun. After
experimenting with, like, nested <code>map</code>s for a few minutes I lost all interest in "fun" and
just went with a couple of <code>for</code> loops!</p>

        <p>Perl has had experimental features ever since I started using it at about version 5.6. These were things that were considered useful, but about which there was doubt -- about their final form, whether a satisfactory implementation existed, or whatever.</p>

<p>Until Perl 5.18, experimental features were simply documented as experimental. At that point, an <code>experimental</code> warning category was added, with sub-categories <code>experimental::lexical_subs</code>, <code>experimental::lexical_topic</code>, <code>experimental::regex_sets</code>, and <a href="https://perldoc.perl.org/perldiag#Smartmatch-is-experimental"><code>experimental::smartmatch</code></a>.</p>

<p>Most of the features covered by the original Perl 5.18 warning categories were actually introduced in Perl 5.10 as back-ports from Raku (or Perl 6, as it was then called), and not documented as experimental. My impression was that the relevant <code>experimental::</code> warnings  were introduced becaue the corresponding features were recognized as being more experimental than originally believed. Programmers already familiar with a feature might not notice an extra sentence in the documentation, but they will surely notice if their code starts spitting out <code>experimental</code> warnings.</p>

<p>Since that time a number of experimental warnings have been introduced, the latest in production being <a href="https://perldoc.perl.org/perldiag#isa-is-experimental">experimental::isa</a> introduced in Perl 5.32 and <a href="https://perldoc.perl.org/perldiag#try/catch-is-experimental">experimental::try</a> introduced in Perl 5.34. As of Perl 5.34, 19 experimental categories are defined, including <code>experimental</code> itself.</p>

<p>In theory, experimental features are eventually judged successful and considered mainstream Perl 5, or judged unsuccessful and removed.</p>

<p>If an experiment is successful, the warnings are removed, but for backward compatibility the warning category remains, even though it no longer corresponds to any diagnostics. These are included in the 19 categories reported a couple paragraphs ago.</p>

<p>If an experiment fails, both its implementation and its warning category are removed, so that any use of it (including an attempt to explicitly enable or disable its warnings) will result in a fatal error. As of Perl 5.34.0 there are only two of these, <code>experimental::autoderef</code> and <code>experimental::lexical_topic</code>, both of which were discussed in <a href="http://blogs.perl.org/users/tom_wyant/2021/11/my-favorite-warnings---ex-warnings.html">My Favorite (?) Warnings - Ex-Warnings</a>.</p>

        <p>This blog post addresses checksum and signature verification vulnerabilities affecting CPAN, the cpan client, and the cpanm client, which were published in a <a href="https://blog.hackeriet.no/cpan-signature-verification-vulnerabilities">security advisory</a> on 23rd November 2021. If you're not aware of this topic, you might like to start by reading <a href="https://blog.hackeriet.no/cpan-signature-verification-vulnerabilities">the advisory</a>. This post gives a high-level description of the issues, what has been done to address them, what is still left to do, and what you should do. If you have any questions on this, you can add comments here, or email the PAUSE admins (modules at perl dot org).</p>

<p>Before we dig into the details, we'll first give an overview of how the relevant parts of the CPAN ecosystem work.</p>

<p>If you're not interested in the details, skip to the section "What do you need to do?"</p>

<p>TL;DR: make sure your CPAN client uses https and a trusted mirror – such as cpan.org</p>

        <h2>How a CPAN module gets from the author to you</h2>

<p>An author creates a new module and wants to share it on CPAN. They build a release, and upload the resulting tarball to PAUSE, where it goes into their author directory (my PAUSE id is NEILB and my author directory can be found on CPAN at <a href="https://www.cpan.org/authors/id/N/NE/NEILB">https://www.cpan.org/authors/id/N/NE/NEILB</a>). If the uploader has the relevant indexing permissions, PAUSE will update the CPAN Index. The Index is a big file which lists all modules on CPAN; here's the entry for the "enum" module, which I currently maintain:</p>

<p><code style="font-family: Source Code Pro,Consolas,Menlo,Courier New,fixed; font-size: 10pt;"><pre>
    enum     1.12      N/NE/NEILB/enum-1.12.tar.gz
</pre></code></p>

<p>It says "if you want enum, the latest version is 1.12 and it's found in the tarball enum-1.12.tar.gz at this path in the authors directory.”</p>

<p>PAUSE also generates checksums for all files in author directories. Every directory has a file called CHECKSUMS (here's an example <a href="https://www.cpan.org/authors/id/G/GL/GLASSER/CHECKSUMS">CHECKSUMS file for user GLASSER</a>. After generating a new CHECKSUMS file, PAUSE signs it with GnuPG.</p>

<p>If you want to install a module, you can download the tarball and install it manually, but most people use a <em>CPAN client</em>. There are four main CPAN clients (<a href="https://metacpan.org/dist/CPAN/view/scripts/cpan">cpan</a>, <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/cpanm">cpanm</a>, <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/cpm">cpm</a>, and <a href="https://metacpan.org/dist/CPANPLUS/view/bin/cpanp">cpanp</a>) but we'll describe use of <a href="https://metacpan.org/dist/CPAN/view/scripts/cpan">cpan</a>, which is the client that's bundled with perl itself. To reduce confusion, we'll use "CPAN.pm" to refer to this client (that's <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/CPAN">the module</a> that the cpan script uses).</p>

<p>To install the module, you run:</p>

<p><code style="font-family: Source Code Pro,Consolas,Menlo,Courier New,fixed; font-size: 10pt;"><pre>
    $ cpan Foo::Bar
</pre></code></p>

<p>The client makes sure it has a recent copy of the index, and looks for the module. If it's in the index, the client looks up the associated tarball and downloads it, along with the CHECKSUMS file that's in the author's directory on CPAN. The client generates a checksum for the downloaded file and compares it with the one in the CHECKSUMS file, and if they match, it goes ahead and installs it.</p>

<p>By default CPAN.pm doesn't check that the signature on the file is valid, but you can optionally enable that check as well. Since it's not enabled by default, the vast majority of us haven't been checking for a valid signature.</p>

<p>If you want to know more, you could start with <a href="http://blogs.perl.org/users/neilb/2016/04/the-perl-toolchain-pause-and-cpan.html">a blog post on how PAUSE and CPAN work</a>, and read a <a href="http://neilb.org/2015/09/05/cpan-glossary.html">CPAN glossary</a> which defines the terminology.</p>

<h2>What issues did the advisory identify?</h2>

<p>There were three issues identified, each of which has a separate CVE. This is a summary here; read the original advisory for the full story. Here are the CVEs: CVE-2020-16154, CVE-2020-16155, and CVE-2020-16156.</p>

<p>All three issues involve someone setting up a malicious CPAN mirror, and getting people to start using it.</p>

<p>The first issue is that the CHECKSUMS file only included the name of the tarball. For example, here's a snippet from the CHECKSUMS file in my author directory, as they appeared before the changes described below:</p>

<p><code style="font-family: Source Code Pro,Consolas,Menlo,Courier New,fixed; font-size: 10pt;"><pre>
  'Date-QuarterOfYear-0.04.tar.gz' => {
      'md5' => '8dd1a29e60af035a652aee121ab0919d',
      'md5-ungz' => '85ba26240f1396a147dcc09413a97db4',
      'mtime' => '2021-06-14',
      'sha256' => '1d13f55e5a1e84a7b05ce8cfd1d4cf9d9da80addd8f5f9fc845d2973daa06200',
      'sha256-ungz' => 'b4808c921b994656498ed74fbbba0677ff88d9624dabeabc4ef4f97b0655482f',
      'size' => 10763
  },
</pre></code></p>

<p>There's no mention of the path there. Someone could create a malicious version of my module and upload a file with the same name to their PAUSE where it winds up in their author directory. Then they could upload copies of everything else in my author directory to PAUSE, so that their author directory looks the same as mine, except one file has been replaced with their malicious copy. Their author directory will have a CHECKSUMS file which looks the same as the one in my author directory, apart from different hashes for the one modified file. Plus it's been signed by PAUSE. They can set up their own CPAN mirror that swaps their author directory in place of mine, and if anyone downloads this tarball, even with the signing of CHECKSUMS validated, they get the malicious code but it looks like it’s coming from me.</p>

<p>The other two CVEs are for an issue that affects both CPAN.pm and cpanm. These again relate to someone setting up a malicious CPAN mirror. They can generate checksums for a directory and prepend an unsigned version of the checksum data to the CHECKSUMS file. Both CPAN.pm and cpanm will take the unsigned checksum data, ignoring the signed version that's also in the same CHECKSUMS file. It turned out that if you enabled the signature verification checks in CPAN.pm and cpanm, if an unsigned version of the CHECKSUM data has been injected above the signed data, then the clients would happily install the tarball for you anyway.</p>

<h2>Addressing the issues</h2>

<p>The first line of protection is to not use untrusted mirrors. In the early days of CPAN, when the internet was slower and more flakey, most of us used a local mirror, so a network of hundreds of CPAN mirrors sprang up. In 2021 they are largely irrelevant.  Since 2019, the mirror list was truncated to just www.cpan.org. Most CPAN clients already default to this or to cpan.metacpan.org (which we also consider a trustworthy source).</p>

<p>If an attacker controls your network traffic, then they could inject malicious tarballs and checksums as well. Using https is the easiest thing you can do here.</p>

<p>CPAN.pm has defaulted to use only cpan.org since 2013 and with the truncation of the mirror list in 2019, any newly configured CPAN.pm clients are not vulnerable to a malicious mirror.  The latest release of CPAN.pm will use https if at all possible.</p>

<p>PAUSE has been updated so that the CHECKSUMS files now include <code>cpan_path</code> for each file, which gives the relative path to the directory for which the checksums were generated.  CPAN.pm will fail to validate if the paths don’t match so a signed CHECKSUMS file can’t be used from a different directory without detection.</p>

<p>CPAN.pm has been updated so that if you have configured it to validate the signature on CHECKSUMS, it will refuse to install a tarball if the associated CHECKSUMS file isn't signed.</p>

<h2>The CPAN clients</h2>

<p>In this section we'll summarise how the various CPAN clients work as of 2021-11-23, so you can make an informed decision on whether to continue using your current client, whether to upgrade, reconfigure, or to switch.</p>

<h3>CPAN.pm / cpan 2.29</h3>

<ul>
<li>It now ignores any previously configured urllist and only uses cpan.org. If you want it to honour the urllist parameter instead, you must set the new pushy_https parameter to false.</li>
<li>It will try to use https, including use of curl or wget if the appropriate modules aren't installed. If none of those approaches work, it will fall back on http://www.cpan.org.</li>
<li>It always looks at the CHECKSUMS file, and if you set <code>check_sigs</code> to true, it will require the CHECKSUMS file to have a valid signature.</li>
</ul>

<h3>cpanm 1.7044</h3>

<ul>
<li>Defaults to using http://www.cpan.org (but can be configured to use https://www.cpan.org – see below).</li>
<li>By default it doesn't look at the CHECKSUMS file.</li>
<li>The <code>--verify</code> option tells it to validate the signature and content of the CHECKSUMS file.</li>
<li>As of 2021-11-23, the latest version of cpanm (1.7044) doesn't address the issues raised, and so will install a distribution with unsigned CHECKSUMS content.</li>
</ul>

<h3>cpm 0.997007</h3>

<ul>
<li>This is the most modern client, and as a result was already in good shape.</li>
<li>By default cpm always uses https and downloads files from MetaCPAN's CPAN mirror, which we consider a trusted source. You can specify your own mirror in the command-line arguments, and even in your cpanfile.</li>
<li>cpm's goal is speed, and as a result it doesn't look at the CHECKSUMS file, and there's no option to ask it to.</li>
</ul>

<h3>cpanp (CPANPLUS) 0.9914</h3>

<ul>
<li>The default mirror is now www.cpan.org</li>
<li>If the "md5" config option is set to "true", it will check that the checksums match. This defaults to true if Digest::SHA is available; this has been a core module since Perl 5.9.3. * There is no option to request verification of the signature.</li>
<li>The default is to not use https, but if you set <code>prefer_bin</code> to true, and configure <code>hosts</code> for https, then it will use https://www.cpan.org as the source.</li>
<li>A new version of CPANPLUS (0.9914) has been released which also checks the cpan_path field, and refuses to install if it doesn't match.</li>
</ul>

<h2>What do you need to do?</h2>

<p>Use only <a href="https://www.cpan.org">https://www.cpan.org/</a> or <a href="https://cpan.metacpan.org">https://cpan.metacpan.org/</a>.  Do not use any other mirror that you have not personally verified is trustworthy.</p>

<p>Here’s how to configure that in different CPAN clients:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>CPAN.pm</strong>: preferably upgrade to version 2.29, or configure your existing installation. In the CPAN shell, run the following command: "o conf urllist https://www.cpan.org", followed by "o conf commit" to save that change.</li>
<li><strong>cpanm</strong>: set the PERL_CPANM_OPT environment variable to ""--from https://www.cpan.org"</li>
<li><strong>cpm</strong>: it is already using https://cpan.metacpan.org, so you don't need to do anything. Check you haven't configured it to use a different mirror, and if you have, either update the config to explicitly use https://cpan.metacpan.org, or remove your configuration so it will use the default.</li>
<li><strong>CPANPLUS</strong>: set the <code>prefer_bin</code> option to true and make sure you've got curl installed. Then set the <code>hosts</code> parameter to <code>{ 'scheme' =&gt; 'https', 'path' =&gt; '/', 'host' =&gt; 'www.cpan.org' }</code></li>
</ul>

<p>If you insist on using an untrusted mirror, configure your CPAN client to verify CHECKSUMS.  Here’s how to do that in different CPAN clients:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>CPAN.pm</strong>: always verifies the checksums, but with the <code>check_sigs</code> option set to true ("o conf check_sigs true" then "o conf commit"), it will check the signature as well.</li>
<li><strong>cpanm</strong>: the --verify option tells it to verify the checksums, so add that to PERL_CPANM_OPT.</li>
<li><strong>cpm</strong>: doesn't verify the checksums, and there is currently no option to request that.</li>
<li><strong>CPANPLUS</strong>: as long as you're using Perl 5.10 or later, it will verify the checksums. There's no option for testing the signature.</li>
</ul>

<h2>What's left to do?</h2>

<p>At the moment CPAN clients can't make https mandatory, because Perl doesn't support https out of the box. We've <a href="https://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl5.porters/2021/11/msg261979.html">raised this on p5p</a>, and this will hopefully lead to an RFC and support for https in the not-too-distant future.</p>

<p>Fixes are being worked on for cpanm, so unsigned CHECKSUMS will be fatal if you've given --verify, and also to support the cpan_path key in the CHECKSUMS files.</p>

<p>We're hoping that CPANPLUS will be updated to try and use https by default, as we've done with CPAN.pm.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>The best way to ensure you're downloading the original versions of CPAN releases is to use a trusted CPAN mirror, and only talk to it over https.</p>

<p>If you are aware of any further potential security issues with PAUSE, or the CPAN clients, you can raise them via email to the PAUSE Admins private email list: pause-admin at perl dot org.</p>

<h2>Acknowledgements</h2>

<p>Firstly, thank you to Stig Palmquist, who identified these issues, and who has been patient and helpful as they were being addressed.</p>

<p>As ever with Perl, this has been a team effort of volunteers. Thank you to the CPAN client authors and others, who have worked on changes, and in some cases are still working. Thank you to everyone who read drafts of this post, and improved it with their input.</p>

<p><em>The examples used here are from The Weekly Challenge problem statement and demonstrate 
the working solution.</em></p>

<h2>Part 1</h2>

<p><em>You are given a list of numbers. Write a script to implement JortSort. It should return 
true/false depending if the given list of numbers are already sorted.</em></p>

<h3>Solution</h3>

<pre><code class="perl">
use strict;
use warnings;
use boolean;

sub jort_sort{
    for(my $i=0; $i < @_ - 1; $i++){
        return false if $_[$i + 1] < $_[$i];  
    }  
    return true;
}

MAIN:{
    print jort_sort(1, 2, 3, 4, 5) . "\n";
    print jort_sort(1, 3, 2, 4, 5) . "\n";
}
</code></pre>

<h3>Sample Run</h3>

<pre><code class="shell">
$ perl perl/ch-1.pl
1
0
</code></pre>

<h3>Notes</h3>

<p>Apparently Jort Sort is a joke sort started by somebody in the JavaScript community. I 
didn't find it all that funny, but the code to implement it only took a quick minute.</p>

<h2>Part 2</h2>

<p><em>Write a script to generate the first 5 Long Primes.</em></p>

<h3>Solution</h3>

<pre><code class="perl">
use strict;
use warnings;
use boolean;
use LWP::UserAgent;
use constant PRIME_URL => "http://primes.utm.edu/lists/small/100000.txt";

            push @primes, @p[1..(@p - 1)]; 
        }  
    }
    return @primes;

    return substr($q, 0, $i + 1) . substr($decimal_part, 0, $r_i) . "(" . substr($q, $i + $r_i + 1) . ")";  
}   

sub long_primes_five{
    my @long_primes;
    my @primes = get_primes();
    do{
        my $prime = shift @primes;    
        my $max_repetend = $prime - 1;

            my $repetend = $1;
            push @long_primes, [$prime, $x] if length($repetend) == $prime - 1;   
        }
    }while(@long_primes < 5);
    return @long_primes;
}

MAIN:{
    for my $p (long_primes_five()){
        print $p->[0] . "\t" . $p->[1] . "\n";
    }
}
</code></pre>

<h3>Sample Run</h3>

<pre><code class="shell">
$ perl perl/ch-2.pl 
7       0.(142857)
17      0.(0588235294117647)

29      0.(0344827586206896551724137931)
</code></pre>

<h3>Notes</h3>

<p>This second part of the challenge was much more fun! Maybe my favorite part was that it 
largely re-used code from <a href="http://www.rabbitfarm.com/cgi-bin/blosxom/2021/04/04#pwc106">challenge 106</a>
and also <a href="https://adamcrussell.livejournal.com/5175.html">Challenge 015</a>. Here we grab a 
list of pre-computed primes and then check each one for the desired property. After we 
find five, as required, we're done.</p>

     <div class="card-body">       <div class="card-text"><p>Hi there</p>
<p>Going back to the editorial of last week's <a href="https://perlweekly.com/archive/537.html">edition</a> of Perl Weekly, it is still there in my head raising many questions. It is a universal fact that Perl is no longer the favourite language among the youths in college these days. I remember when I was first introduced to Perl in 1999, it was the most popular language. Being a Perl fan, I feel it is my responsibility to bring Perl back to the discussion table. One way to do that is to talk about Perl-based projects and share them with the users of other languages. I have noticed that not as many people blog about Perl as they used to in the past. Talking about blogs, I would like to thank <a href="https://theweeklychallenge.org">The Weekly Challenge</a> team for spreading the power of Perl. For the record, in the last 138 weeks, the team have created and shared over 2000 blog posts. I used to blog regularly in the past but nowadays I hardly find time. Having said that, I still wrte a monthly report blog post where I talk about Perl and my other projects. I find making a live video is less time consuming than writing a blog post. I made some and then I stopped that as well, sorry. You can take a look my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/mohammadsajidanwar">YouTube Channel</a> if you fancy. I came across series of <a href="https://perlmaven.com/beginner-perl-maven-video-course">videos</a> by Gabor Szabo teaching Perl. It is great source for someone new to Perl and explore with live action.</p>
<p>I remember, Dave Cross, wrote a <a href="https://dev.to/davorg/don-t-be-a-perl-programmer-4h2d">blog post</a> talking about something that not many people would speak about. I personally agree with him fully and believe knowing more than one programming languages helps you as a programmer. I can tell from my own experience, I picked up Raku last year while participating the weekly challenge. Whatever little I know about Raku to date, I can tell it has helped me a lot. I use that knowledge to write better Perl programs. Recently, I started writing Python as well - just the basics for now. So the question is, does knowing Raku or Python make me any less of a Perl programmer? I am still a Perl programmer and all of my thought processes still follow Perl's rules. Perl is my first love and will remain so for the rest of my life. Even today, after more than 22 years, I find features that I never knew existed before, especially in the field of regex. I would like to give credit to Abigail for sharing the magic of regex in Perl as part of his weekly contributions.</p>
<p>While talking about blogs, how can I miss those who are doing great service on a regular basis? I would like to thank <a href="https://github.polettix.it/ETOOBUSY">Flavio Poletti</a> for blogging every day for months now. Also there is another name, <a href="https://phoenixtrap.com">Mark Gardner</a>, who writes a weekly blog post. Similarly we have weekly stats by <a href="https://niceperl.blogspot.com">Miguel Prz</a>.</p>

     <p>Daniel Sockwell has provided two updates to his <a href="https://news.perlfoundation.org/post/grant_proposal_persistent_data_structures_for_raku">Grant: Persistent Data Structures for Raku</a>.</p>

<p>The first update was already submitted in October, and not posted due to my own error. Enjoy the thorough description!</p>

<hr />

<h2>Raku Persistent Data Structures Grant Report for September 2021</h2>

<p>In September, I spent 28 hours on implementing Raku persistent data structures.  That's a bit under
the 10 hour/week I'd estimated that I'd spend, but I was still able to make a good start on the
implementation.</p>

<p>The main reason I didn't spend the full 40 hours on the grant – as well as the explanation for why
you're getting this update now instead of closer to the beginning of the month – is that I decided
to devote a large chunk of my Raku time to two other issues – both of which are directly related to
implementing persistent data structures.  (Though not <em>so</em> related that I'm counting time spent on
them towards the grant.  Which is good, because doing so would mean that I <em>well</em> exceeded my
~40/month budget!)</p>

<p>I'm going to tell you a bit about these two projects and how each relates to Raku persistent data
structures, and then I'll describe the progress I made during the 28 hours I'm actually counting.</p>

<h3>What even is immutability?</h3>

<p>The biggest selling point of persistent data structures is, of course, that they are immutable while
also being fairly cheap to copy.  But to deliver on that promise, it's important to have a very
clear idea of what we mean by "immutability".</p>

<p>I don't mean in some sort of fancy <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heraclitus">philosophical sense</a>;
I'm asking the very practical question "When we describe the <code>List</code> in <code>my $list = (1, 2, 3)</code> as
immutable, what does that mean?  What different <em>behavior</em> should I expect when I know that the
<code>List</code> is immutable?" (You could say "semantic difference" instead of "different behavior" if you
want to sound a bit more technical.)</p>

<p>Raku has some very clear answers to parts of this question but is also slightly confused (to say
nothing of confusing) on some others.  And, as it turns out, some of the less-clear areas of the
question end up being pretty significant for the sort of immutability that give persistent data
structures so much of their power. </p>

<p>Let's start with an area where Raku is clear: the distinction between immutable <strong>values</strong> and
immutable <strong>bindings</strong>.  This is <a href="https://docs.raku.org/language/containers">well documented</a> (and
isn't what I spent time on; this is still background), but here's a recap:</p>

<h4>Values</h4>

<p>When we describe the list <code>(1, 2, 3)</code>, the string <code>codesections</code>, or the number <code>42</code> as
immutable, we are saying that they are immutable <em>values</em>.  That is, there's no way to take <code>(1, 2,
3)</code> and change the <code>2</code> into a <code>0</code> while still having the same list we started with – we can create a
new list with those values, but that's not at all the same thing.  Contrast that with the <code>Array</code> of
<code>my @a = [1, 2, 3]</code>: here, the code <code>@a[1] = 0</code> literally changes the existing <code>Array</code>.</p>

<p>Strings and numbers in Raku are immutable values in exactly the way <code>List</code>s are (and <code>Array</code>s
aren't).  That is, there's no way to transform a string or a number; all you can do is to return a
modified version of the string or number.  In contrast, C, C++, Rust, and many other languages allow
you to mutate strings in-place; they essentially treat strings as arrays of characters or codepoints
and let you modify that array in exactly the same way Rakoons modify an <code>Array</code>.  (For C's <code>char*</code>
strings, you're literally dealing with character arrays; for other languages that's more of an
(over) simplification).  I'm pretty sure that no programming language is crazy enough <a href="http://rigaux.org/language-study/various/mutability-and-sharing/">to have
mutable numbers</a> (math would get
<em>weird</em>) but I'd love to learn that I'm wrong about that.</p>

<p>Note that I'm discussing the semantics of immutable values that Raku (the language) provides, not
implementation details of how any particular compiler stores those values.  So, while <code>List</code>s and
<code>Str</code>s provide immutable semantics, there's nothing preventing an implementation from storing
different values in a more complex way.  Put differently, when you say <code>my $a = 'foo' x 500; my $b =
$a ~ ' and bar'</code>, you <em>conceptually</em> have two separate and immutable strings, but implementations
are free to let those strings share (or even mutate) some of their backing data.  And, indeed, MoarVM
uses a really amazing system for <a href="https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/blob/master/docs/sts.asciidoc">storing
strings</a> that shares memory in a way
that's not that different from the way the data structures I'm building do.</p>

<h4>Bindings</h4>

<p>Entirely separate from the question of mutable versus immutable values, programming languages can
also constrain the mutability of variable bindings.  That is: once the programmer has defined a
variable as pointing at a particular value, can they later change it to point at a <em>different</em>
value?</p>

<p>One non-Raku example that many programmers may be familiar with is JavaScript's <code>let</code> and <code>const</code>,
especially when used with arrays or objects.  In JavaScript, <code>const</code> enforces immutable bindings –
you can't say <code>const a = [1, 2, 3]; a = [4, 5, 6]</code>.  But it does nothing to make the <em>values</em>
immutable – and, in js, arrays are always mutable.  This means that you can validly write <code>const a =
[1, 2, 3]; a[1] = 99</code> to mutate the value that <code>a</code> points to.  (This distinction, and the lack of
immutable arrays in JavaScript, leads to <a href="https://overreacted.io/on-let-vs-const/">perennial
debates</a> about the advisability of using <code>const</code> in js.)</p>

<p>Raku gives us accesses to the semantics of both mutable and immutable bindings, and lets us combine
either with mutable or immutable values.  Thus, we can write <code>my @a = [1, 2, 3]</code> - mutable binding
to a mutable value.  Or <code>my $l = (1, 2, 3)</code> – an mutable binding to an immutable value (we can't
change the value of the <code>List</code>, but we <em>can</em> make <code>$l</code> point to a different value altogether).  Or
we can write <code>constant @a = [1, 2, 3]</code> – an immutable binding to a mutable value (<code>@a</code> will always
point to that exact <code>Array</code>, but we can freely mutate that <code>Array</code> with code like <code>@a[1] = 99</code>).
Or, finally, we can write <code>constant $l = (1, 2, 3)</code> – an immutable binding to an immutable value
(<code>$l</code> will always point to the same <code>List</code>, and that <code>List</code> will always contain exactly the values
<code>1</code>, <code>2</code>, and <code>3</code>).</p>

<p>This last category – an immutable binding to an immutable value – best fits many peoples intuitions
about what the terms "immutable" or "constant" mean – that variable always gives me the same value,
no matter what.  In addition to being more intuitive, this last category is notable for how much it
can simplify reasoning about code.  There's something very clarifying about knowing the value of a
variable without needing to track whether that value has changed; just like the related idea of
using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referential_transparency">referentially transparent</a> functions,
programming with variables that are immutably bound to immutable values can greatly simplify complex
codebases.</p>

<h4>How immutable values and binding fit with persistent data structures</h4>

<p>The distinction between the mutability of values and bindings matters for the data structures I'm
implementing in two ways.</p>

<p>First, because the data structures I'm creating are immutable values, we'll be able to use them to
be in that wonderful forth category – immutable binding to immutable values – if and only if Raku
lets us bind to them immutably.  So it's really important to be clear on what options Raku provides
for immutable bindings.</p>

<p>I've already shown one way that Raku supports immutable bindings: <code>constant $l = (1, 2, 3)</code>.  But
constants are evaluated at compile time and (even though Raku's definition of "compile time" is
pretty expansive) the options for using constants are inherently limited.  So what other options
does Raku provide?</p>

<p>Well, before the beginning of September, I thought that Raku provided three other options for
immutable bindings: so-called <a href="https://docs.raku.org/language/variables#index-entry-_(sigilless_variables)">sigilless
variables</a> (like <code>my
\l = (1, 2, 3)</code>); function parameters that aren't declared as <a href="https://docs.raku.org/type/Signature#index-entry-trait_is_rw"><code>rw</code> or
<code>copy</code></a> (like <code>sub fn($l) {…}</code>); and
lists of variables that are destructured with the <code>:=</code> operator (which share the same semantics as
parameters).  Now, in mid-October, I <strong>still</strong> think that's the case, but I admit that the situation
is more complex than I first thought and, at a minimum, existing compilers don't fully implement
those semantics.</p>

<p>(Note: some people don't like the term "sigilless variable", since the semantics I just described
mean that they don't really vary.  But it's the term the docs use, so I'm going to stick with it for
this post.)</p>

<p>I first realized something odd was going on when comment in this <a href="https://github.com/Raku/doc/issues/3950">docs.raku.org
issue</a> pointed out that, while you can't reassign a
sigilless variable, you can sometimes re-<a href="https://docs.raku.org/language/containers#Binding">bind</a>
it: <code>my Int \x = 2; x := 4</code> changes the value bound to <code>x</code>.  At first I thought that this issue only
applied when certain type constraints were applied, but I soon realized that it applied whenever
any type is mentioned, including <code>Any</code> or <code>Mu</code>.  Moreover, it's not just sigilless variables that
can be rebound – parameters can too: <code>sub f(Any $a) { $a := 42; $a}; f 0</code> returns 42.  In the last
step to make this pervasive, the <code>@</code> and <code>%</code> sigils add implicit type constraints, which means that
any parameter with either of those sigils can be rebound.  (As mentioned, destructuring with <code>:=</code>
shares the semantics of parameter binding, all of that applies there as well.)</p>

<p>Given that sigilless variables and parameters both allowed rebinding, all of the above lead me to
wonder whether Raku is trying to provide immutable bindings at all.  It turns out that there isn't a
<a href="https://github.com/Raku/roast">Roast</a> specification test that's 100% on point.  And, when I <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/69231506/what-are-the-rules-for-re-binding">asked
on StackOverflow</a> I
mixed opinions about whether the current behavior (allowing rebinding) was intentional or a bug.</p>

<p>If Raku does pervasively allow rebinding, that would be pretty bad news for the usefulness of the
data structures I'm implementing.  They'd still have some value – more than enough to be
worthwhile.  But it'd mean that we pretty much can never get to the
immutable-bindings-to-immutable-values promised land that can have such a simplifying effect on
code.</p>

<p>Given that impact, I decided to research the issue pretty thoroughly.  After doing so, I've
concluded that Raku is designed to provide immutable bindings after all, and I produced a <a href="https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/pull/4536">pull
request</a> that both explains my logic and provides a
patch that gives Raku those semantics.  That PR hasn't been merged yet (I still need to respond to
at least one change request about what error to throw, and I'd like to see if anyone else weighs
in).  But I'm optimistic that it will be and that fixing that bug will make immutable bindings to
immutable values much more practical in Raku.</p>

<h4>What's on the inside</h4>

<p>I mentioned earlier that the values-versus-binding distinction is important for the work I'm doing
in two ways.  The second way it matters is because it gives us the right framework to talk about
"shallow" immutability (also sometimes called <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/69231506/what-are-the-rules-for-re-binding">interior
mutability</a>).</p>

<p>Lets look at a slightly different constant: <code>constant $l = (1, 2, $)</code>.  What can we say about <code>$l</code>?
Well, the variable <code>$l</code> is immutably bound to a <code>List</code>, and the <code>List</code> is comprised of three values,
<code>1</code>, <code>2</code>, and … a <a href="https://docs.raku.org/language/containers#Scalar_containers">scalar</a>.  But a
scalar a container – specifically, a <em>mutable</em> container.  Thus, despite the immutability of <code>$l</code>'s
binding and the immutability of <code>List</code>s, we can still make changes: <code>$l[2] = 99</code> is valid code.</p>

<p>That change is allowed because <code>List</code>s are only <em>shallowly</em> immutable.  Or, to say the same thing in
different words, <code>List</code>s are an immutable type that allows for interior mutability.</p>

<p>One of the goals I mentioned in the <a href="https://news.perlfoundation.org/post/grant_proposal_persistent_data_structures_for_raku">initial grant proposal for the persistent data
structures</a>
is to provide deeply immutable data types.  I hope that the discussion so far gives some context to what I
meant by that.  But it's a point I'll return to in a just a minute.</p>

<h3>Meanwhile, in another thread altogether…</h3>

<p>The second related-but-distinct task has occupied a good deal of my time recently has involved
concurrency and parallelism (which are famously <a href="https://go.dev/blog/waza-talk">not the same
thing</a>).  One of the key selling points of immutable data –
especially deeply immutable data – is that it can be more easily shared across threads.  A lot of
the headache of dealing with parallel code (locks, mutexes, atomics, cache misses, deadlocks,
livelocks, etc) come from ways to prevent different threads from modifying data at the same time.
But different threads will never modify (deeply) immutable data at the same time – because <em>nothing</em>
will ever mutate that data at any time.  I'm very optimistic that the data structures I'm working on
will have significant application for anyone writing multithreaded Raku. </p>

<p>So I've been slightly concerned that I hadn't yet written any non-trivial parallel and concurrent
code in Raku.  Not <em>that</em> concerned – I've written quite a bit of concurrent and parallel Rust code
and concurrent JavaScript (JS is single-threaded, so it's inherently non-parallel).  And I'd gotten
to know Raku's concurrency model by watching some excellent
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hGyzsviI48M&amp;t=43s">conference</a>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2fSbOPeSQs&amp;t=1184s">talks</a> and by reading the
<a href="https://docs.raku.org/language/concurrency">docs</a>/<a href="https://6guts.wordpress.com/2017/11/24/a-unified-and-improved-supply-concurrency-model/">other</a>
<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/65473206/what-concurrency-mechanisms-are-provided-by-raku-and-how-can-they-be-evaluated">resources</a>.
Still, though, I was keeping my eye out for a medium-scale project that would let me confirm my
understanding of Raku's approach to concurrency.</p>

<p>In late September, I found the perfect project.  Someone on the r/rakulang subreddit asked if there
was a good way to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rakulang/comments/pvdpd2/recreate_javascript_bouncing_balls_in_raku/">recreate a JavaScript exercise in
Raku</a>.
That exercise involved rendering balls to an HTML5 canvas in a browser – a task that's pretty
challenging with a version of Raku running on MoarVM.  (It would obviously be much easier using the
JavaScript backend, but that wouldn't currently be my first choice for someone new to Raku.)  So, I
decided to write a simple <a href="https://cro.services/">Cro</a> server that would let someone write Raku code
to display balls on an HTML canvas.</p>

<p>Specifically, I decided on the following architecture: A Cro server that would listen for commands
from the user's Raku code, generate a set of balls to display, and then send a JSON representation
of those balls to any connected clients via WebSockets.  Oh, and then do that again with updated
ball positions 16 milliseconds later – with the goal of maintaining a frame rate of 60 fps.  It's
this last bit would normally be a bit of an odd choice: WebSockets are typically used to communicate
with a remote server, and thus it'd typically be a questionable choice to stream updates 60 times
per second.  But the program I had in mind would run locally, which removes network latency from
consideration.  And, besides, I figured that this design would provide good trial by fire for my
understanding of Raku's concurrency model: if my program can stream balls to dozens of
simultaneously connected clients at 60 fps, I must have a pretty decent understanding of how Raku
handles parallelism and concurrency.</p>

<p>You can see the <a href="https://github.com/codesections/LearnRakuWith">program I ended up with</a> on GitHub.
I'm pretty happy with how it turned out: in not much more than 100 lines of Raku, the program sets
up exactly the architecture described above plus an
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erlang_(programming_language)">Erlang</a>-style error recovery strategy
for resetting to a known-good state when user input that doesn't produce valid output.</p>

<p>But getting there took longer than I expected it to and, in the middle, had me seriously questioning
whether I actually understood Raku's concurrency model well enough to be implementing new data
structures that'd fit with it.  One of the first things anyone learns about programming is that "<a href="https://blog.plover.com/2017/11/12/">it
is not a compiler error. It is never a compiler error.</a>"  In
other words, even if some issue <em>seems</em> to be caused by a bug in the compiler/runtime/etc, it's far
more likely to be caused by a bug in your own code.</p>

<p>And when writing that module, I kept running into some crashes that made me think that I'd either
run into the mythical compiler bug or – more likely – was seriously misunderstanding how to write
concurrent code.  After spending quite a bit of time double-checking my code, I determined that, as
expected, I had <em>not</em> run into a compiler bug.  No, I'd run into
<a href="https://github.com/croservices/cro-websocket/issues/36">two</a> of
<a href="https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/issues/1565">them</a>.</p>

<p>In fairness, neither was a <em>compiler</em> bug; they were both issues with the MoarVM runtime.  Moreover,
both were fixed extremely quickly, and the second never even made it into production – I only ran
into it because I was using a pre-release build to try out Rakudo's <a href="https://6guts.wordpress.com/2021/09/29/the-new-moarvm-dispatch-mechanism-is-here/">new dispatch
mechanism</a>.  The
whole point of running pre-release builds is to help catch edge-case bugs like these, and I'm
certainly not complaining – but it turns out that streaming 60 fps to dozens of clients was a good
stress test for the new dispatch system and not just for my understanding of Raku's concurrency
model.</p>

<h3>Lessons for persistent data structures</h3>

<p>Once I realized that I wasn't fundamentally misunderstanding concurrency in Raku, implementing
Learn::Raku::With taught me a couple of lessons with important (though subtle) implication for the
persistent data structures I'm building.</p>

<h4>"Concurrency control" ≠ "concurrency"</h4>

<p>The first lesson I learned is that I'd slightly misunderstood what's going on in code like this
(adapted from <a href="https://docs.raku.org/routine/migrate">an example</a> in the docs):</p>

<p>```raku</p>

<h1>A simple stock ticker for Apple and Google stock</h1>

<p>react {
    whenever $stock-info-for-APPL { say "Apple's stock price is now:  $_ " }
    whenever $stock-info-for-GOOG { say "Google's stock price is now: $_ " }
}
```</p>

<p>My previous (<strong>incorrect</strong>) reading of that example was pretty much just an English version of the
code:</p>

<p>&gt; Whenever we get an update about either Apple or Google's stock, print that update.  We don't know
&gt; when these updates could come, but we want to react to them the instant they do, whether that
&gt; means reacting to the Apple one first, reacting to the Google one first, or reacting to both at
&gt; the same time.</p>

<p>That's <em>so close</em> to correct, but it goes wrong in the very last 7 words: we are guaranteed <strong>not</strong>
to react to both updates at the same time.  This is a consequence of Raku's
<a href="https://6guts.wordpress.com/2017/11/24/a-unified-and-improved-supply-concurrency-model/#user-content-supplies-and-concurrency">run-to-completion</a>
semantics: the code inside a <code>whenever</code> block is guaranteed to finish executing (that is, to "run to
completion") before the code in any other <code>whenever</code> block can start.  This wouldn't matter much for
the simple example above, but here are two modified versions in which it would:</p>

<p>```raku</p>

<h1>Lets store our results in a Map instead of printing them</h1>

<p>react {
    my %prices is Map;
    react {
        my Map $prices = Map.new;
        whenever $stock-info-for-APPL { $prices = %(|$prices, :APPL($<em>)) }
        whenever $stock-info-for-GOOG { $prices = %(|$prices, :GOOG($</em>)) }
    }
}
```</p>

<p>Under the incorrect understanding, we could've be in both <code>whenever</code> blocks at the same time and
this would create a race condition – we might lose a price update if two came in at the same time.
However, because the concurrency control Raku provides <em>prevents</em> concurrent access here, this is
actually 100% fine: we'll be in exactly one <code>whenever</code> block at a time.  Raku's semantics protect us
from any race condition.</p>

<p>Here's an example where Raku's semantics would have a less ideal impact on naive code:</p>

<p>```raku</p>

<h1>Now with buy/sell recomendations!</h1>

<p>react {
    whenever $stock-info-for-APPL { 
        say "Apple's stock price is now:  $_ ";
        say "Rating: " ~slow-fn-to-calculte-recomendation('APPL', $<em>);
    }
    whenever $stock-info-for-GOOG { 
        say "Google's stock price is now: $</em> ";
        say "Rating: " ~slow-fn-to-calculte-recomendation('GOOG', $_);
    }
}
```</p>

<p>This code would <em>not</em> behave as the author might hope, due to those same run-to-completion
semantics.  Specifically, while <code>slow-fn-to-calculate-recomendation</code> is running, other updates would
be blocked.  If you don't want this behavior, Raku offers several ways to schedule work outside of
the run-to-completion guarantee of the <code>whenever</code> block; Raku's semantics aren't going to <em>stop</em> you
from doing anything here, but it's important to understand the behavior they provide by default. </p>

<p>(It may be helpful to compare Raku's semantics to JavaScript, which guarantees that <em>every</em> function
will run to completion before any other work begins – a model I've <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/67679309/raku-equivalent-to-javascripts-settimeoutfn-0">contrasted with Raku's
before</a>.)</p>

<p>So, how does all of this impact persistent data structures?  Well, some of the performance
optimizations for persistent data structures involve temporarily suspending the immutability
guarantee when there's provably only one copy of the data (or part of the data).  And whether that's
provably the case or not depends crucially on whether other sections of the program can have
concurrent access to the data.  So being clear on all of the above is pretty essential for safe
implementations of the data structures I'm working on.</p>

<h4>Under pressure</h4>

<p>I mentioned that implementing Learn::Raku::With helped me learn two lessons, but the second was
really a reminder of a Raku concurrency feature that I already knew about/a good example of how
important that feature can be.  The feature I'm talking about is the way Raku manages backpressure.</p>

<p>Raku's high level concurrency tools are carefully designed with backpressure in mind.  Quoting
directly from the <a href="https://6guts.wordpress.com/2017/11/24/a-unified-and-improved-supply-concurrency-model/">6guts blog
post</a> that
I've already linked to:</p>

<p>&gt; Another interesting problem for any system processing asynchronous messages is that of
&gt; backpressure. In short, how do we make a source of messages emit them at a rate no greater than
&gt; that of the processing logic? The general principle with Supply is that the sender of a message
&gt; pays the cost of its processing. So, if I have <code>$source.map(&amp;foo).tap(&amp;bar)</code>, then whatever emits at
&gt; the source pays the cost of the map of that message along with the processing done by the tap callback.</p>

<p>Backpreasure is extremely helpful because it can allow a program to handle arbitrary amounts of
input without requiring a proportionally arbitrary (i.e., infinite) amount of memory.  Of course,
given Raku's commitment to flexibility and programmer control, it shouldn't come as any surprise
that Raku also makes it easy to opt out of this automatic backpreasure when doing so makes sense.</p>

<p>Learn::Raku::With presents a good example of a situation where it makes sense to opt out of Raku's
default backpressure semantics.  As I mentioned above, Learn::Raku::With generates a stream of
frames and transmits those frames to all connected clients.  If we applied backpressure to this
system in the normal way, then transmitting the frames to the clients would exert backpressure on
generating the frames – that is, we'd be guaranteed not to generate frames any faster than we can
transmit them.</p>

<p>This would have some benefits – most notably, we'd never need to buffer generated frames and our
memory use would never grow.  But, in the Learn::Raku::With context, it'd have one very notable flaw
as well: the normal backpreasure system would mean that any time we can't transmit frames to clients
at 60 fps, the actual <em>speed</em> of Learn::Raku::With's balls would get reduced.  This obviously isn't
ideal – while 60 fps is a nice goal to shoot for, 45 fps is an absolutely fine frame rate and it'd
be much better to drop 1 out of 4 frames and to display the balls at normal speed in 45 fps than to
keep every frame but to display the balls in slow motion.</p>

<p>Thus, Learn::Raku::With <a href="https://github.com/codesections/LearnRakuWith/blob/main/lib/HtmlBalls.rakumod#L70-L78">pairs a Supply with a
Channel</a> to
allow it to drop frames instead of generating frames more slowly – but that, of course, means that
it needs to store at least a few frames at least temporarily.</p>

<p>But storing extra frames, in turn, means both that the program will take up more memory and,
crucially, that there will be more work for the garbage collector to do.  And that work will take
some time – time that necessarily cannot be spent transmitting those frames to the client.  But
since the whole reason we need to store those extra frames was that we're generating them faster
than we can ship them off to the client, it's possible for the GC-pause-induced extra delay to
result in <em>more</em> extra frames.  Which can then result in more garbage to collect, and thus more
delay, and thus more frames.</p>

<p>I'm sure you can see where that sort of infinite loop heads and it's certainly not to anywhere
good.  In fact, a previous version of Learn::Raku::With could get itself into exactly that sort of
situation pretty easily, consuming ever-more RAM and operating ever more slowly (I think I measured
it as hitting at least 50 GB).  The current version is much more resilient, but the risk remains.</p>

<p>All of this is relevant to persistent data structures because one of the main benefits of these data
structures is that the power of structural sharing makes copies vastly less expensive – verging on
free, in fact.  This benefit would go a long way towards avoiding the sort of issues I outlined
above.  I'd always known that these inexpensive copies are a key benefit of the persistent data
structures I'm building, but I'd previously focused on this as a way to reduce the memory footprint
of Raku programs.  After building Learn::Raku::With, however, I recognize that structural sharing
also reduces GC pressure and thus improves the speed at which Raku programs can execute – which can
avoid the sort of death spirals described above.  This means that having persistent data structures
will not only make many Raku programs more memory efficient but will also certain of Raku programs
much more feasible to write without spiraling into a need for ever-increasing amounts of RAM.</p>

<h2>Implementation progress</h2>

<p>So, having spent a few thousand words explaining things related to but not directly covered by the
grant, let me say at least a bit about the implementation work itself.  In the nature of
implementation work, it's not nearly as interesting as more exploratory work and I don't have very
much to say – I've very much stuck to the plan in my <a href="https://news.perlfoundation.org/post/grant_proposal_persistent_data_structures_for_raku">grant
proposal</a>.</p>

<p>Specifically, I started by implementing the persistent version of the <code>List</code> (still open to
bikeshedding on the name!).  I have made good progress on implementing a persistent <code>List</code> that with
the structural sharing features described in my proposal but <em>without</em> the bit-shifting indexing
(I'm instead currently using the simplified indexing scheme that involves converting the key to a
different base and calculating the relevant indices manually).  This simplified indexing scheme will
allow me to test the soundness of the list before switching to the bit-shifting index (which will be
key to the performance of the persistent list).</p>

<p>Additionally, I've written a set of tests to confirm the correctness of my implementation so far and
a (much smaller and still preliminary) set of tests that measure the performance of deep copies of
built in <code>List</code>s and <code>Array</code>s, which should provide a nice baseline to compare the persistent
versions against.</p>

<h1>Conclusion</h1>

<p>Over the course of September, I made a good start on implementing persistent data structures for
Raku.  This included significant, though limited, progress on actually implementing the persistent
List and much more time-consuming work on auxiliary projects (not counted as part of my grant hours)
that have given me a much better foundation for the remaining work.  The downside of this auxiliary
work is that it took up considerable time that I might have devoted to the actual implementation,
both in September and in October.  In fact, given the amount of time I've already spent on these
research/side projects in October, it's possible that I won't have much or any grant progress to
report at the end of this month.  Nevertheless, I'm glad I invested the effort into those projects
since I believe both left me significantly better equipped to carry out the remainder of the grant.
I look forward to putting these lessons into practice as I continue to implement persistent data
structures for Raku.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Raku Persistent Data Structures Grant Report for October 2021</h2>

<p>The expectation I mentioned in my September grant report came true in October: I had significantly
less time to devote to work on this grant in October.  This was due in large part to the conceptual
work I previously reported on, which stretched well into October.</p>

<p>Accordingly, I was only able to spend 5 hours on the grant in October; I used that time to continue
work on the persistent List.  Specifically, I nearly completed the basic API (without the
bit-shifting optimizations).  I was also able to add some initial test coverage. Given that
progress, I am now nearing point where I'll be able to share the WIP code publicly.</p>

<p>On the conceptual front (i.e., work that's relevant to the persistent data structures but not
relevant enough that I'm counting it towards the hours funded by this grant), I've also made a fair
bit of progress.  Most significantly, I was able to complete the work to add fully immutable binding
to Rakudo.  Thanks to some helpful feedback from Vadim Belman, I also added significantly more
detailed error messages, which should help explain the nature of these binding to Rakoons who aren't
as used to programming with in an immutable style.  As discussed in my last grant report, being able
to immutably bind values to their names will mean that the persistent data structures implemented
for this grant will be truly immutable – and thereby significantly easier to reason about.  This
work was merged in <a href="https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/pull/4536">rakudo#4536</a> and should be part of
the 2021.11 Rakudo release.</p>

<p>Additionally, I've been putting some thought into how Raku's notion of <a href="https://docs.raku.org/language/glossary#Value_type">value
types</a> fits with the persistent data structures
I'm implementing.  As I mentioned last month, one of the core motivations behind this grant proposal
is to provide deeply immutable types, so it's clear that the types I'm implementing will be value
types and thus will return a <a href="https://docs.raku.org/type/ValueObjAt">ValueObjAt</a> from their <code>WHICH</code>
method.  But what should the persistent types do when the user adds a non-value type?  I can see
three options:</p>

<ol>
<li>Throw an error/require the user to create a value type to pass in.  This is basically the approach taken by Elizabeth Mattijsen's  <a href="https://modules.raku.org/dist/ValueType:zef:zef:lizmat/">ValueType</a> module.</li>
<li>Recursively copy each non-value type into an equivalent value type when it's added to the persistent type ("copy-on-read").  This is straightforward for some types (an <code>Array</code> becomes a <code>List</code>) but might involve more metaprogramming trickery for others (especially user classes).
<ol>
<li>Store the non-value type if we can prove that no other part of the code has access to it, and only make a copy if we need to hand it out to someone (basically copy-on-write, with some slight tweaks).</li>
</ol></li>
</ol>

<p>Each of these has different pros and cons.  In particular, the first is the easiest to implement, the most verbose, and gives the user the most control over/awareness of the performance costs.  Conversely, the last is the most "magical" and the only one that risks introducing correctness bugs.  Additionally, there could be ways to combine different aspects of these three approaches – for example, one combination of 1. and 2. would be to copy simple/built in types but to throw an error when passed a user type with a mutable field.  I'm currently leaning towards the copy-on-read option #2 as a reasonable middle ground, but it's definitely something I'd be interested in hearing other thoughts on.</p>

<p>November is already off to a good start, and I'm optimistic that I'll be able to make significant
progress on this grant before the end-of-year business (and exciting things like the <a href="https://github.com/Raku/advent/blob/master/raku-advent-2021/authors.md">Raku Advent
Calendar</a>!) start to eat
into my coding time.</p>

<p>The Perl Weekly newsletter is more than 10 years old and over those years we have witnessed a huge decline in the number and diversity of posts. There are still a few people who write about Perl regularly, The Weekly Challenge of Mohammad generates many posts, but in general we see fewer and fewer posts.</p>
<p>I wonder, do those people who used to write about Perl write about other technologies or have they just stopped? How come that so few people write about Perl? Are there no new things in Perl? Are there no new problems that one solves in Perl?</p>
<p>I know that writing about stuff is not the same thing as writing the stuff, but as many other people who write or teach will attest, the best way to improve your knowledge is to explain it. to explain it to live audience (at a Meetup) or to write about it in a blog post.</p>
<p>So how do you spend your free time? Do you write more code? Do you try to explain what you wrote, how you wrote and why? Or do you spend your time on some other activities? I, for examples started to read a lot more than I did in the recent years. And sure, I'll even share my recommendations with you. (See below.)</p>
