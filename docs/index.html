<p>What is openpilot?<br>
openpilot is an open source driver assistance system. Currently, openpilot performs the functions of Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC), Automated Lane Centering (ALC), Forward Collision Warning (FCW) and Lane Departure Warning (LDW) for a growing variety of supported car makes, models and model years. In addition, while openpilot is engaged, a camera based Driver Monitoring (DM) feature alerts distracted and asleep drivers.</p>

<p>Integration with Stock Features<br>
In all supported cars:</p>

<p>Stock Lane Keep Assist (LKA) and stock ALC are replaced by openpilot ALC, which only functions when openpilot is engaged by the user.<br>
Stock LDW is replaced by openpilot LDW.<br>
Additionally, on specific supported cars (see ACC column in supported cars):</p>

<p>Stock ACC is replaced by openpilot ACC.<br>
openpilot FCW operates in addition to stock FCW.<br>
openpilot should preserve all other vehicle's stock features, including, but are not limited to: FCW, Automatic Emergency Braking (AEB), auto high-beam, blind spot warning, and side collision warning.</p>

<p>Supported Hardware<br>
At the moment, openpilot supports the EON DevKit and the comma two. A car harness is recommended to connect the EON or comma two to the car. For experimental purposes, openpilot can also run on an Ubuntu computer with external webcams.</p>

<p>Supported Cars:<br>
<a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ek47ble0--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/nnm9ompxuomkmks96p16.PNG" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ek47ble0--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/nnm9ompxuomkmks96p16.PNG" alt="Alt Text"></a></p>

<p>1Comma Pedal is used to provide stop-and-go capability to some of the openpilot-supported cars that don't currently support stop-and-go. NOTE: The Comma Pedal is not officially supported by comma.<br>
22019 Honda Civic 1.6L Diesel Sedan does not have ALC below 12mph.<br>
3When disconnecting the Driver Support Unit (DSU), openpilot ACC will replace stock ACC. NOTE: disconnecting the DSU disables Automatic Emergency Braking (AEB).<br>
428mph for Camry 4CYL L, 4CYL LE and 4CYL SE which don't have Full-Speed Range Dynamic Radar Cruise Control.</p>

<p>Community Maintained Cars and Features<br>
<a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--qHKA56vi--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/1dc5f0uxdapr9wdbz8lv.PNG" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--qHKA56vi--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/1dc5f0uxdapr9wdbz8lv.PNG" alt="Alt Text"></a></p>

<p>1Requires an OBD-II car harness and community built ASCM harness. NOTE: disconnecting the ASCM disables Automatic Emergency Braking (AEB).<br>
2Only includes the MQB Passat sold outside of North America. The NMS Passat made in Chattanooga TN is not yet supported.</p>

<p>Community Maintained Cars and Features are not verified by comma to meet our safety model. Be extra cautious using them. They are only available after enabling the toggle in Settings-&gt;Developer-&gt;Enable Community Features.</p>

<p>To promote a car from community maintained, it must meet a few requirements. We must own one from the brand, we must sell the harness for it, has full ISO26262 in both panda and openpilot, there must be a path forward for longitudinal control, it must have AEB still enabled, and it must support fingerprinting 2.0</p>

<p>Although they're not upstream, the community has openpilot running on other makes and models. See the 'Community Supported Models' section of each make on our wiki.</p>

<p>Installation Instructions<br>
Install openpilot on an EON or comma two by entering <a href="https://openpilot.comma.ai">https://openpilot.comma.ai</a> during the installer setup.</p>

<p>Follow these video instructions: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcjqxCymins">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcjqxCymins</a> , to properly mount the device on the windshield. Note: openpilot features an automatic pose calibration routine and openpilot performance should not be affected by small pitch and yaw misalignments caused by imprecise device mounting.</p>

<p>Before placing the device on your windshield, check the state and local laws and ordinances where you drive. Some state laws prohibit or restrict the placement of objects on the windshield of a motor vehicle.</p>

<p>You will be able to engage openpilot after reviewing the onboarding screens and finishing the calibration procedure.</p>

<p>Limitations of openpilot ALC and LDW<br>
openpilot ALC and openpilot LDW do not automatically drive the vehicle or reduce the amount of attention that must be paid to operate your vehicle. The driver must always keep control of the steering wheel and be ready to correct the openpilot ALC action at all times.</p>

<p>While changing lanes, openpilot is not capable of looking next to you or checking your blind spot. Only nudge the wheel to initiate a lane change after you have confirmed it's safe to do so.</p>

<p>Many factors can impact the performance of openpilot ALC and openpilot LDW, causing them to be unable to function as intended. These include, but are not limited to:</p>

<p>Poor visibility (heavy rain, snow, fog, etc.) or weather conditions that may interfere with sensor operation.<br>
The road facing camera is obstructed, covered or damaged by mud, ice, snow, etc.<br>
Obstruction caused by applying excessive paint or adhesive products (such as wraps, stickers, rubber coating, etc.) onto the vehicle.<br>
The device is mounted incorrectly.<br>
When in sharp curves, like on-off ramps, intersections etc...; openpilot is designed to be limited in the amount of steering torque it can produce.<br>
In the presence of restricted lanes or construction zones.<br>
When driving on highly banked roads or in presence of strong cross-wind.<br>
Extremely hot or cold temperatures.<br>
Bright light (due to oncoming headlights, direct sunlight, etc.).<br>
Driving on hills, narrow, or winding roads.<br>
The list above does not represent an exhaustive list of situations that may interfere with proper operation of openpilot components. It is the driver's responsibility to be in control of the vehicle at all times.</p>

<p>Limitations of openpilot ACC and FCW<br>
openpilot ACC and openpilot FCW are not systems that allow careless or inattentive driving. It is still necessary for the driver to pay close attention to the vehicle’s surroundings and to be ready to re-take control of the gas and the brake at all times.</p>

<p>Many factors can impact the performance of openpilot ACC and openpilot FCW, causing them to be unable to function as intended. These include, but are not limited to:</p>

<p>Poor visibility (heavy rain, snow, fog, etc.) or weather conditions that may interfere with sensor operation.<br>
The road facing camera or radar are obstructed, covered, or damaged by mud, ice, snow, etc.<br>
Obstruction caused by applying excessive paint or adhesive products (such as wraps, stickers, rubber coating, etc.) onto the vehicle.<br>
The device is mounted incorrectly.<br>
Approaching a toll booth, a bridge or a large metal plate.<br>
When driving on roads with pedestrians, cyclists, etc...<br>
In presence of traffic signs or stop lights, which are not detected by openpilot at this time.<br>
When the posted speed limit is below the user selected set speed. openpilot does not detect speed limits at this time.<br>
In presence of vehicles in the same lane that are not moving.<br>
When abrupt braking maneuvers are required. openpilot is designed to be limited in the amount of deceleration and acceleration that it can produce.<br>
When surrounding vehicles perform close cut-ins from neighbor lanes.<br>
Driving on hills, narrow, or winding roads.<br>
Extremely hot or cold temperatures.<br>
Bright light (due to oncoming headlights, direct sunlight, etc.).<br>
Interference from other equipment that generates radar waves.<br>
The list above does not represent an exhaustive list of situations that may interfere with proper operation of openpilot components. It is the driver's responsibility to be in control of the vehicle at all times.</p>

<p>Limitations of openpilot DM<br>
openpilot DM should not be considered an exact measurement of the alertness of the driver.</p>

<p>Many factors can impact the performance of openpilot DM, causing it to be unable to function as intended. These include, but are not limited to:</p>

<p>Low light conditions, such as driving at night or in dark tunnels.<br>
Bright light (due to oncoming headlights, direct sunlight, etc.).<br>
The driver's face is partially or completely outside field of view of the driver facing camera.<br>
The driver facing camera is obstructed, covered, or damaged.<br>
The list above does not represent an exhaustive list of situations that may interfere with proper operation of openpilot components. A driver should not rely on openpilot DM to assess their level of attention.</p>

<p>User Data and comma Account<br>
By default, openpilot uploads the driving data to our servers. You can also access your data by pairing with the comma connect app (iOS, Android). We use your data to train better models and improve openpilot for everyone.</p>

<p>openpilot is open source software: the user is free to disable data collection if they wish to do so.</p>

<p>openpilot logs the road facing camera, CAN, GPS, IMU, magnetometer, thermal sensors, crashes, and operating system logs. The driver facing camera is only logged if you explicitly opt-in in settings. The microphone is not recorded.</p>

<p>By using openpilot, you agree to our Privacy Policy. You understand that use of this software or its related services will generate certain types of user data, which may be logged and stored at the sole discretion of comma. By accepting this agreement, you grant an irrevocable, perpetual, worldwide right to comma for the use of this data.</p>

<p>Safety and Testing<br>
openpilot observes ISO26262 guidelines, see SAFETY.md for more details.<br>
openpilot has software in the loop tests that run on every commit.<br>
The safety model code lives in panda and is written in C, see code rigor for more details.<br>
panda has software in the loop safety tests.<br>
Internally, we have a hardware in the loop Jenkins test suite that builds and unit tests the various processes.<br>
panda has additional hardware in the loop tests.<br>
We run the latest openpilot in a testing closet containing 10 EONs continuously replaying routes.<br>
Testing on PC<br>
For simplified development and experimentation, openpilot can be run in the CARLA driving simulator, which allows you to develop openpilot without a car. The whole setup should only take a few minutes.</p>

<p>Steps:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Start the CARLA server on first terminal<br>
bash -c "$(curl <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/commaai/openpilot/master/tools/sim/start_carla.sh)">https://raw.githubusercontent.com/commaai/openpilot/master/tools/sim/start_carla.sh)</a>"</p></li>
<li><p>Start openpilot on second terminal<br>
bash -c "$(curl <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/commaai/openpilot/master/tools/sim/start_openpilot_docker.sh)">https://raw.githubusercontent.com/commaai/openpilot/master/tools/sim/start_openpilot_docker.sh)</a>"</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Press 1 to engage openpilot<br>
You should also take a look at the tools directory in master: lots of tools you can use to replay driving data, test, and develop openpilot from your PC.</p>

<p>Community and Contributing<br>
openpilot is developed by comma and by users like you. We welcome both pull requests and issues on GitHub. Bug fixes and new car ports are encouraged.</p>

<p>You can add support for your car by following guides we have written for Brand and Model ports. Generally, a car with adaptive cruise control and lane keep assist is a good candidate. Join our Discord to discuss car ports: most car makes have a dedicated channel.</p>

            </div> <!-- card-header -->
     <div class="card-body">       <div class="card-text">
        <p>Dear TPF Board members,</p>

<p>We want to express our disappointment with the recent transparency reports and associated actions from the Community Affairs Team (CAT).</p>

<p>On Monday 19th March, a <a href="https://news.perlfoundation.org/post/cat-transparency-repor-19-april-2021">first Transparency Report</a> was issued, which said that an individual had been investigated for (1) behaviour on IRC and Twitter, and (2) behaviour at a Perl event in 2019. The report also reported that they had "found many instances of communication which alone may not have constituted unacceptable behavior, but when taken together did constitute unacceptable behavior", but no further details were given on those. The report issued a ban from all TPF events "in perpetuity", and furthermore issued a ban on the individual’s participation on irc.perl.org and any perl.org mailing lists. A second individual was issued a warning.</p>

<p>Prior to the 19th, one of the Perl Steering Council (PSC) members explicitly asked you not to issue a ban, saying that the PSC were already starting work on <a href="https://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl5.porters/2021/04/msg259909.html">improving discourse in and around p5p</a>. That person felt that a ban would be counterproductive when the PSC were trying to improve things in a more inclusive way. The second event was the Perl Toolchain Summit (PTS). The incident was investigated at the time, resulting in two of the organisers (Philippe Bruhat and Neil Bowers) asking the individual to leave. He left peacefully, expressing regret that he had upset and offended the other party. The PTS is <em>not</em> a TPF event.</p>

<p>Nearly two weeks after the initial report, TPF issued a <a href="https://news.perlfoundation.org/post/cat-transparency-report-updates0">Transparency Report Update</a>, which retracted parts of the first report, but left other parts hazy. For example, the first report mentions other "unacceptable behaviour", but gives no further details in either report. The warning for the second individual was retracted.</p>

<p>The use of "transparency" seems incongruous:</p>

<ul>
<li>No charter for the CAT had been published, nor a common set of guidelines as the basis of triggering investigations or taking corrective actions.</li>
<li>No definition for “unacceptable behavior” was provided.</li>
<li>The CAT did not talk to the relevant communities or their leaders before publishing the initial report.</li>
<li>The CAT had not spoken to either person investigated prior to publishing the first report.</li>
</ul>

<p>These behaviours don't demonstrate the values and behaviours that we could reasonably expect of a body investigating community affairs. As the most visible and official Perl organization, TPF should hold itself to a higher standard.</p>

<p>This felt like a clumsy attempt by TPF to establish control over all Perl communities, and only when you got push-back did you attempt to wind some of that back. You do not have jurisdiction over IRC, email lists, or most other parts of our communities. It is not TPF/CAT’s role  to request that people stop participating. We have not given you consent to unilaterally define policy across our communities, nor impose punishments on behalf of them.</p>

<p>We are all firm supporters of codes of conduct, where the goal is to set expectations for behaviour. Many of our individual communities have long defined and enforced their own guidelines and standards of conduct. That said, we believe that our communities could benefit from harmonising standards. This was an opportunity for TPF/CAT to demonstrate leadership, and start bringing our communities together towards a unified policy. Instead the TPF acted seemingly without consideration for the varied needs and devolved leadership of the communities it purports to represent.</p>

<p>This is not to say that we condone the individual's behaviour. Some signatories to this letter were part of the governing bodies that issued the initial corrective actions on the two incidents the CAT cited. We also do not want to diminish the upset and offence that the individual has caused to a number of people over the years.</p>

<p>We would like to see TPF acknowledge its failings in how this has been handled, and make changes to ensure these aren't repeated, but we're not looking for a blood-letting and further division. We would like to see this debacle as a catalyst for our communities coming together to move things forward. We need to clarify the organisation and governance structures of our communities, and start the process of defining common values and expectations around behaviour. This needs to be a community-led activity: given recent events, we don't feel that TPF/CAT is currently fit for a leadership role in this, but we would absolutely want your participation.</p>

<p>In volunteer communities such as ours, leadership is about doing the hard work of building consensus, not imposing your will on the rest of us. Leadership should be a service we provide to our communities.</p>

<p>Been quite a year for every one on this big blue marble.  I hope you are all good.</p>

<p>Ok here is the very short post for today.</p>

<p>I just did my first build and upload of <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/release/BYTEROCK/Paws-0.43/lib/Paws.pm">PAWS</a> to CPAN</p>

<p>Expect Version 0.43 to be up there later today some time.</p>

<p>It was a bit of an epic on my part as this whole releasing thingy, made some real bad goofs (deleting then checking in a folder), thank goodness for 'git revert'  and getting the version number wrong.</p>

<p>Hopefully is comes out ok.</p>

<p>Look for more releases in the future.</p>

<p><strong>Thanks for your support and encouragement ...</strong></p>

<p>I had many ups and downs in the month of <strong>April</strong>. In all these, I have recieved plenty of supporting voices.</p>

<p>First, we had the start of <strong>Ramadan</strong>. I feel fortunate to be able to fast in this holy month. However I had to break my fast for two days because I suffered by <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/vertigo/"><strong>Vertigo</strong></a>. Luckily I recovered very fast, thanks to <strong>ALLAH s.w.t.</strong></p>

<p>As you all know, I have started taking part in the weekly challenge after rather a long break. Although I am only sharing solutions in <strong>Perl</strong> for the time being. Soon, I would start doing in <strong>Raku</strong> and <strong>Swift</strong>. Having said, I started live coding regularly in recent weeks. Please find below the links to all videos that I created last month. I use <strong>OBS Studio</strong> to create live videos. Someone recently complained about the audio quality. So I bought the <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Blue-Microphones-Snowball-iCE-Microphone/dp/B014PYGTUQ/">Blue Microphone Snowball Ice</a>. I noticed the audio quality was way better. Feeling brave, I started making changes to the configuration to make it even more crisper. While doing so, I broke the standard settings. I panicked. I asked for help on <a href="https://twitter.com/cpan_author">Twitter</a> and within no times, I had plenty of help. After fierce fighting for a week, I got it working in the end.</p>

<p>There is another big news that I would like to share with you all. After nearly <strong>9 years</strong> with <a href="https://hello.global.ntt/en-us/">NTT</a>, I decided to move on and accepted an offer from <a href="https://www.oleeo.com/">Oleeo</a>. I joined as <strong>Senior Perl Developer</strong> on <strong>4th May 2021</strong>. I was fortunate to receive the grand welcome by everyone. I was plesantly surprised that so many people knew me already. I met familiar faces as well e.g. <strong>Andrew Solomon</strong> (<a href="https://geekuni.com/">Geekuni</a>) and <strong>James Raspass</strong> (<a href="https://code.golf/">Code Golf</a>). Thanks to <strong>Julien Fiegehenn</strong>, my induction went very smooth.</p>

<p><strong>Any new projects in the pipeline?</strong></p>

<p>Well, there are two, one in <strong>Perl</strong> and another in <strong>Python</strong>. I will share the details in the next monthly report as I am still preparing the ground.</p>

<p>That's it for now. Stay safe and healthy.</p>

<p>Let's take a quick look through last month main activities.</p>

     <div class="card-body">       <div class="card-text"><p>Most of us probably know <a href="https://curl.se/">curl</a> as a quick and easy way to send HTTP requests from the command line.</p>

<p>That tool, though, is just an interface to the curl project’s real gold: the libcurl API. Using this API, applications in all sorts of languages have easy access to the awesome power that libcurl provides. This article will discuss how to use that power in Perl.</p>

<h1>
  <a href="#a-quick-example">
  </a>
  A Quick Example
</h1>



<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>use Net::Curl::Easier;

my $easy = Net::Curl::Easier-&gt;new(
    url =&gt; 'http://perl.org',
    followlocation =&gt; 1,
)-&gt;perform();

print $easy-&gt;head(), $easy-&gt;body();
</code></pre>

</div>



<p>Let’s talk about what just happened.</p>

<p><a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Net::Curl::Easier">Net::Curl::Easier</a> is a thin wrapper around <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Net::Curl">Net::Curl</a>’s “easy” interface—<a href="https://curl.se/libcurl/c/libcurl-easy.html">“easy” is what libcurl calls it!</a>—that smooths over some rough edges in Net::Curl.</p>

<p>(Full disclosure: I am Net::Curl::Easier’s maintainer.)</p>

<p>Once we create our “Easier” object, having given it the proper URL and told it to follow HTTP redirects (<code>followlocation</code> refers to <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Location">HTTP’s <code>Location</code> header</a>), we run <code>perform()</code> on the Easier object.</p>

<p>After that, we print the HTTP response headers and body, and we’re done!</p>

<h1>
  <a href="#why-not-just-use-httptiny">
  </a>
  Why not just use <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/HTTP::Tiny">HTTP::Tiny</a>?
</h1>

<p>Indeed. Well, error reporting, for one. Consider:<br>
</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>Net::Curl::Easier-&gt;new(
    url =&gt; 'http://blahblah',
)-&gt;perform();
</code></pre>

</div>



<p>If you run this you’ll probably just see <code>Couldn't resolve host name</code> printed to standard error. But if you dig deeper you’ll see something nifty:<br>
</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>use Net::Curl::Easier;
use Data::Dumper;

eval {
    Net::Curl::Easier-&gt;new(
        url =&gt; 'http://blahblah',
    )-&gt;perform();
};
print Dumper $@;
</code></pre>

</div>



<p>It turns out that that error isn’t just a string; it’s an exception <em>object</em>.</p>

<p>In large systems I often want to handle certain failure types differently from others. HTTP::Tiny’s errors are just strings, so type-specific failure handling with HTTP::Tiny entails <em>parsing strings</em>, which is brittle. What if someone decides to reword some error message for clarity, thus breaking my string parser?</p>

<p>With Net::Curl I can look for specific numeric error codes, documentation for which <a href="https://curl.se/libcurl/c/libcurl-errors.html">the curl project itself maintains</a>. This is much more robust.</p>

<h1>
  <a href="#dont-care-what-else-you-got">
  </a>
  Don’t care. What else you got?
</h1>

<p>OK. How about this:<br>
</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>my $easy = Net::Curl::Easier-&gt;new(
    username =&gt; 'hal',
    userpwd =&gt; 'itsasecret',
    url =&gt; 'imap://mail.example.com/INBOX/;UID=123',
)-&gt;perform();
</code></pre>

</div>



<p>I just queried … an email inbox?!?</p>

<p>Curl doesn’t just speak HTTP; it speaks many other protocols including IMAP, LDAP, SCP, and MQTT. To see the full list of protocols that your curl supports, run <code>curl --version</code>.</p>

<h1>
  <a href="#concurrency">
  </a>
  Concurrency
</h1>

<p>Curl can also run concurrent queries. To do that I recommend using <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Net::Curl::Promiser">Net::Curl::Promiser</a>. (Full disclosure: I also maintain this module.)</p>

<p>Example, assuming use of <a href="http://metacpan.org/pod/Mojolicious">Mojolicious</a>:<br>
</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>use Net::Curl::Easier;
use Net::Curl::Promiser::Mojo;
use Mojo::Promise;

my $easy1 = Net::Curl::Easier-&gt;new(
    url =&gt; 'http://perl.org',
    followlocation =&gt; 1,
);

my $easy2 = Net::Curl::Easier-&gt;new(
    username =&gt; 'hal',
    userpwd =&gt; 'itsasecret',
    url =&gt; 'imap://mail.example.com/INBOX/;UID=123',
);

my $easy3 = Net::Curl::Easier-&gt;new(
    username =&gt; 'hal',
    userpwd =&gt; 'itsasecret',
    url =&gt; 'scp://tty.example.com/path/to/file',
);

my $promiser = Net::Curl::Promiser::Mojo-&gt;new();

Mojo::Promise-&gt;all_settled(
    $promiser-&gt;add_handle($easy1)-&gt;then( sub {
        print $easy1-&gt;head(), $easy1-&gt;body();
    } ),
    $promiser-&gt;add_handle($easy2)-&gt;then( sub {
        # ... whatever you want with the IMAP result
    } ),
    $promiser-&gt;add_handle($easy3)-&gt;then( sub {
        # ... whatever you want with the SCP result
    } ),
)-&gt;wait();
</code></pre>

</div>



<p>We just grabbed a web page, queried a mailbox, and downloaded a file via SCP, all in parallel!</p>

<p>Note, too, that this method interfaces seamlessly with other promises. So if you have existing <a href="http://metacpan.org/pod/Mojo::UserAgent">Mojo::UserAgent</a>-based code, you can add requests for other protocols alongside it.</p>

<p>Net::Curl::Promiser also works natively with<br>
<a href="http://metacpan.org/pod/AnyEvent">AnyEvent</a> and<br>
<a href="http://metacpan.org/pod/IO::Async">IO::Async</a>, should those be of greater interest to you. It also provides a convenience layer for custom <a href="https://perldoc.perl.org/perlfunc#select-RBITS%2CWBITS%2CEBITS%2CTIMEOUT">select</a>-based event loops, in case that’s how you roll.</p>

  Other Modules
</h1>

<p>Some alternatives to modules presented above:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/AnyEvent::YACurl">AnyEvent::YACurl</a>: A newer library than Net::Curl that simplifies the interface a bit. It assumes use of <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/AnyEvent">AnyEvent</a>, though, so if you’re not using AE then this may not be for you.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/WWW::Curl">WWW::Curl</a>: The library of which Net::Curl is a fork. It can do much of what Net::Curl does but lacks access to libcurl’s <a href="https://curl.se/libcurl/c/libcurl-multi.html">MULTI_SOCKET interface</a>, which is faster and more flexible than curl’s internal <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/2/select">select</a>-based manager for concurrent requests.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Net::Curl::Simple">Net::Curl::Simple</a>: A wrapper by Net::Curl’s original author. It provides some of the same conveniences as Net::Curl::Promiser and Net::Curl::Easier but uses callbacks rather than promises.</p></li>

     <p>Regarding his Raku CI Bot grant, Patrick writes:</p>

<hr />

<p>In April I didn't find much time to work on the Raku CI Bot grant, because non 
computer things required my time.</p>

<p>I added more API mappings to my clone of [the GitHub module](https://
github.com/fayland/perl6-WebService-GitHub). In particular I added relevant 
parts of the Checks, Pulls, OAuth and Issues APIs. I also rebased my changes 
on the <a href="https://github.com/khalidelboray/perl6-WebService-GitHub">fork of khalid</a> who incidentally also started working on the GitHub API module. I then 
learned they started working on automatic binding generation based on the API 
description and <a href="https://github.com/khalidelboray/perl6-WebService-GitHub/issues/1#issuecomment-829923786">offered to jump in</a>.</p>

<p>I also cleaned up the architecture scribbles of the core logic of the 
application. I hope to publish a post about it soon.</p>

        <p>These are some answers to the Week 111 of the <a href="https://perlweeklychallenge.org/blog/perl-weekly-challenge-111/">Perl Weekly Challenge</a> organized by <a href="http://blogs.perl.org/users/mohammad_s_anwar/">Mohammad S. Anwar</a>.</p>

<p><em>Spoiler Alert:</em> This weekly challenge deadline is due in a few  days (May 9, 2021). This blog post offers some solutions to this challenge, please don’t read on if you intend to complete the challenge on your own.</p>

<h2>Task 1: Search Matrix</h2>

<p><em>You are given 5x5 matrix filled with integers such that each row is sorted from left to right and the first integer of each row is greater than the last integer of the previous row.</em></p>

<p><em>Write a script to find a given integer in the matrix using an efficient search algorithm.</em></p>

<p><em>Example:</em></p>

<pre><code>Matrix: [  1,  2,  3,  5,  7 ]
        [  9, 11, 15, 19, 20 ]
        [ 23, 24, 25, 29, 31 ]
        [ 32, 33, 39, 40, 42 ]
        [ 45, 47, 48, 49, 50 ]

Input: 35
Output: 0 since it is missing in the matrix

Input: 39
Output: 1 as it exists in the matrix
</code></pre>

<p>We&#8217;re only trying to know whether an integer exists in the matrix. What I would normally do in such case is transform the data structure, i.e. store all the matrix items into a hash and then simply look whether an item exists in the hash. And I&#8217;ll also present such a solution.</p>

<p>However, looking carefully at the working of the task, we can see that the task insists on the fact that the integers are in ascending order from left to right and from top to bottom. The task further tells us that we should use an efficient algorithm. Although this is not explicitly specified, it is quite clear that we&#8217;re expected to implement a binary search algorithm, which is an efficient algorithm with sorted data.</p>

<p>The first idea might be to flatten the matrix into a one-dimension array, making the dataset much easier to use with a canonical binary search algorithm. But, obviously, that&#8217;s also not really what we&#8217;re expected to do. The task author wants us to implement a binary search algorithm on a 2-D matrix. We could come up with an &#8220;approximate&#8221; binary search, i.e. an heuristic looking for the approximate mid-point between two values. For example, we could start by testing any item on the third row and then goto the 2nd or 4th row depending on the result of the test. But that&#8217;s not satisfactory: that would not scale easily to other dimensions.</p>

<p>So I decided to perform the binary search on a list of consecutive integers between 0 and 24, and to provide a subroutine to convert these integers into 2-D indices. For example, the sixth item in that range corresponds to indices <code>[1][0]</code>.</p>

<h3>Search Matrix in Raku</h3>

<h4>Using Binary Search</h4>

<p>The <code>A2AoA</code> subroutine converts a flat rank into 2-D indices. We simply run a binary search on the <code>0..24</code> range and use the <code>A2AoA</code> subroutine to find out the correspond values in the matrix. Our test cases will be quite exhaustive, since we&#8217;ll be searching the matrix for every integer between 0 and 54.</p>

<pre><code>use v6;

my @matrix = (  1,  2,  3,  5,  7 ),
             (  9, 11, 15, 19, 20 ),
             ( 23, 24, 25, 29, 31 ),
             ( 32, 33, 39, 40, 42 ),
             ( 45, 47, 48, 49, 50 );

sub A2AoA ($index) {
    my ($i, $j) = $index.polymod(5).reverse;

<p>Note that I&#8217;m happy that I used such exhaustive test cases, since my original implementation had a relatively rare bug that I had not seen with the six or seven values I initially tested.</p>

<h4>Using a Hash</h4>

<p>As I said in the introduction, in the real life, I would transform the input data into a hash and simply perform hash lookup.</p>

<pre><code>use v6;

my @matrix = (  1,  2,  3,  5,  7 ),
             (  9, 11, 15, 19, 20 ),
             ( 23, 24, 25, 29, 31 ),
             ( 32, 33, 39, 40, 42 ),
             ( 45, 47, 48, 49, 50 );

my %hash;
for @matrix -&gt; @row {
    %hash{$_} = 1 for @row;
}
say "$_ =&gt; ", %hash{$_} ?? 1 !! 0 for 0..54;
</code></pre>

<p>As it can be seen, the code is much shorter, much simpler and much less prone to errors. It produces the same output:</p>

<pre><code>$ raku ./search_item2.raku

<h3>Search Matrix in Perl</h3>

<h4>Using Binary Search</h4>

<p>This is a port to Perl of the binary search algorithm explained in the introduction above. The <code>A2AoA</code> subroutine converts a flat rank into 2-D indices. We simply run a binary search on the <code>0..24</code> range and use the <code>A2AoA</code> subroutine to find out the correspond values in the matrix. Our test cases will be quite exhaustive, since we&#8217;ll be searching the matrix for every integer between 0 and 54.</p>

<pre><code>use strict;
use warnings;
use feature "say";

my @matrix = ( [  1,  2,  3,  5,  7 ],
               [  9, 11, 15, 19, 20 ],
               [ 23, 24, 25, 29, 31 ],
               [ 32, 33, 39, 40, 42 ],
               [ 45, 47, 48, 49, 50 ]
             );

sub A2AoA {
    my $index = shift;
    my ($i, $j) = (int $index / 5, $index % 5);
}
sub bin_search {
    my $in = shift;
    my ($min, $max) = (0, 24);
    while ($max &gt; $min) {
        my $pivot =  int (($max + $min) /2);
        my ($i, $j) = A2AoA $pivot;
        my $val = $matrix[$i][$j];
        # say "val = $val, $i, $j";
        return 1 if $val == $in;
        if ($in &gt; $val) {
            $min = $pivot + 1;
        } else {
            $max = $pivot;
        }
    }
    return 0;
}
say "$_ =&gt; ", bin_search $_ for 0..54;
</code></pre>

<p>This program displays the following output:</p>

<pre><code>perl  ./search_item.pl
0 =&gt; 0

</code></pre>

<h4>Using a Hash</h4>

<p>As mentioned above, in the real life, I would transform the input data into a hash and simply perform hash lookup. In Raku, I had to use nested <code>for</code> loops to populate the hash because my attempts using chained <code>map</code>s did not work as expected. There is certainly a way to do it with chained <code>map</code>s, but it is not easy to find the right syntax. No such problem with Perl where my chained <code>map</code>s worked perfectly on my first attempt (see below). There has to be something for which Perl is better or (more convenient) than Raku.</p>

<pre><code>use strict;
use warnings;
use feature "say";

my @matrix = ( [  1,  2,  3,  5,  7 ],
               [  9, 11, 15, 19, 20 ],
               [ 23, 24, 25, 29, 31 ],
               [ 32, 33, 39, 40, 42 ],
               [ 45, 47, 48, 49, 50 ]
             );

my %hash = map { $_ =&gt; 1 } map { @$_ } @matrix;
say "$_ =&gt; ", exists $hash{$_} ? 1 : 0 for 0..54;
</code></pre>

<p>This displays the same output as before:</p>

<pre><code>$ perl search_item2.pl
0 =&gt; 0
1 =&gt; 1

<h2>Task 2: Ordered Letters</h2>

<p><em>Given a word, you can sort its letters alphabetically (case insensitive). For example, “beekeeper” becomes “beeeeekpr” and “dictionary” becomes “acdiinorty”.</em></p>

<p><em>Write a script to find the longest English words that don’t change when their letters are sorted.</em></p>

<p>For this, I&#8217;ll use an English word list contributed to the public domain by Grady Ward as part of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moby_Project">Moby Lexicon</a> project. It is a list of 113,809 crosswords, that is words that are considered valid in crossword puzzles and other word games. The list can be found on my <a href="https://github.com/LaurentRosenfeld/think_raku/blob/master/Supplementary/words.txt">github repository</a>.</p>

<h3>Ordered Letters in Raku</h3>

<p>We don&#8217;t really need to sort the letters: we only need to know whether they are already in the alphabetical order. In Raku, we can use the <code>[...]</code> reduce metaoperator together with the <code>le</code> less than or equal to operator on the letters of the word. Checking whether a list is sorted has a smaller computational complexity than sorting the list, so this should presumably be faster (although it is so fast with my 113-k word list that it doesn&#8217;t really matter).</p>

<pre><code>use v6;

my @long-words;
my $max-length = 0;

for './words.txt'.IO.lines -&gt; $word {
    next unless [le] $word.comb;
    my $length = $word.chars;
    if  $length &gt; $max-length {
        @long-words = $word,;
        $max-length = $length;
    } elsif $length == $max-length {
        push @long-words, $word;
    }
}
say @long-words.join(", ");
</code></pre>

<p>This program finds two 7-letter words satisfying the task&#8217;s criteria and displays the following output:</p>

<pre><code>$ raku ./ordered-letters.raku
beefily, billowy
</code></pre>

<p>I do not know what these two words mean, but they are in the input list and they satisfy the criteria.</p>

<h3>Ordered Letters in Perl</h3>

<p>It is slightly less convenient in Perl than in Raku to check that the letters are already in the proper order, so I&#8217;ll simply sort the letters and compare the output with the input word.</p>

<pre><code>use strict;
use warnings;
use feature "say";

my @long_words;
my $max_length = 0;

my $word_list = "./words.txt";
open my $IN, "&lt;", $word_list or die "Cannot open $word_list $!";
while (my $word = &lt;$IN&gt;) {
    chomp $word;
    next unless $word eq join '', sort split //, $word;
    my $length = length $word;
    if  ($length &gt; $max_length) {
        @long_words = ($word);
        $max_length = $length;
    } elsif ($length == $max_length) {
        push @long_words, $word;
    }
}
say "@long_words";
</code></pre>

<p>This program produces the same two words:</p>

<pre><code>$ perl ordered-letters.pl
beefily billowy
</code></pre>

              <h2 class="card-title"><a href="https://dev.to/davorg/easier-web-sites-for-cpan-modules-1nn4">Easier web sites for CPAN modules</a></h2>
            </div> <!-- card-header -->
     <div class="card-body">       <div class="card-text"><p>A few months ago, Gabor asked if <a href="https://dev.to/szabgab/perl-modules-with-their-own-web-site-2gmo">more CPAN modules should have their own web sites</a>. I replied, saying thought it was a good idea and pointing out <a href="https://dev.to/davorg/simple-cpan-module-web-sites-with-github-pages-29ka">how easy it was to create project web sites</a> on GitHub Pages.</p>

<p>But since then, I've been wondering if could be made even easier. Perhaps we could make it easy enough that there was really no reason not to have a web site for your CPAN module.</p>

<p>And today I've released <a href="https://metacpan.org/release/App-CPANModuleSite">App::CPANModuleSite</a> that does just that.</p>

<p>The default usage is pretty easy.</p>

<ul>
<li>Install the module</li>
<li>In your repo checkout run <code>mksite &lt;distribution-name&gt;</code>
</li>
<li>Run <code>git add docs</code> to add your new website directory to your repo</li>
<li>Commit the changes and push the commit</li>
<li>Configure your repo to support GitHub pages (I covered that in <a href="https://dev.to/davorg/simple-cpan-module-web-sites-with-github-pages-29ka">my earlier blog post</a>)</li>
</ul>

<p>And you'll have a basic web site for your module at the web address https://&lt;github-user&gt;.github.io/&lt;repo-name&gt;.</p>

<p>The default site is pretty basic. And it has a big banner across the page saying that you haven't put any effort into the site yet. But that's simple enough to fix. Just add a file called <code>tt_lib/intro.tt</code> to your repo that contains a bit of HTML which explains more about what your module does. The next time you rebuild the site, that text will replace the default paragraph.</p>

<p>Other than that, the default site contains:</p>

<ul>
<li>The documentation for all of the modules in your distribution</li>
<li>Links to other standard pages about your module (CPAN, CPAN testers, CPANTS, things like that)</li>
<li>Links to your code repo and issue tracker (if they are defined in your CPAN metadata)</li>
</ul>

<p>It's also simple to add more pages to your site. Just add files in a <code>site_src</code> directory in your repo. Any file in that directory whose name ends in <code>.tt</code> will be processed by the Template Toolkit and the output will be stored in the <code>/docs</code> directory (with the <code>.tt</code> stripped from the name). Any files without a <code>.tt</code> extension will just be copied into <code>/docs</code>. If you're adding pages, then you'll almost certainly also want to edit the navbar on the page to contain links to your new pages.</p>

<p>Default versions of various template files in <code>/site_src</code> and <code>/tt_lib</code> are installed as part of App::CPANModuleSite's installation. To edit them, you just copy them into the same directory in your repo and edit the copied versions. Any files found inside your repo will take precedence over the versions in the default directories.</p>

<p>Any templates that you write (or existing ones that you edit) will have access to a few template variables:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>distribution</strong> is a <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/MetaCPAN::Client::Distribution">MetaCPAN::Client::Distribution</a> object containing details of your distribution</li>
<li>
<strong>release</strong> is a <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/MetaCPAN::Client::Release">MetaCPAN::Client::Release</a> object containing details of the latest release of your distribution</li>
<li>
<strong>modules</strong> is an array reference, where each element of the array is a <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/MetaCPAN::Client::Module">MetaCPAN::Client::Module</a> object containing details of one module in your distribution</li>
</ul>

<p>This is all pretty experimental currently. I'm very happy to add more information to the default pages, more variables to the template engine and make pretty much any other changes that any users suggest. Let's work together to make this a useful and powerful web site generation tool.</p>

<p>I have a couple of thoughts for things I want to do next:</p>

<ul>
<li>I've already started work on creating a GitHub Action, so that you can automatically regenerate the site, for example, whenever you check in a change to your code</li>
<li>The whole point of this is that more CPAN web sites mean better SEO for Perl. So I plan to think of ways that make the default sites as SEO-friendly as possible</li>
</ul>

<p>Please let me know what you think. Do you think this is a good idea? Will you use the module?</p>

<p>Oh, and the site that App::CPANModuleSite generated for itself is at <a href="https://davorg.dev/app-cpanmodulesite/">https://davorg.dev/app-cpanmodulesite/</a>.</p>

     <div class="card-body">       <div class="card-text"><p>Hi there</p>
<p>I am not sure if you have read the recent <a href="http://neilb.org/2021/04/27/perl-communities.html">blog post</a> by Neil Bowers. I have read it multiple times to understand the subject of the post. I must admit, I had never read such an in depth analysis of the term "Community". As my vocabulary is rather limited, I found it very interesting to read such a long blog post. To me, community is group of like-minded people. When I attended my first London Perl Workshop, I immediately felt part of the community. The organiser and everybody was so accommodating and friendly. It made me come again the following year and I became addicted to it afterwards. I always looked up to the big names of the community everytime I needed some inspiration. Take a look at the <a href="https://www.perl.org/advocacy/white_camel/">past recipients</a> of the White Camel Award, you can get some idea of who's who in the community. Unfortunately it hasn't been awarded since 2018 for some reason that I am not aware of. I miss the community spirit of attending Perl Conferences. You can never experience that feeling unless you attend one. I hope and wish we get back to attending conferences. Although there has been virtual events in recent times, it can't replace real events in my humble opinion. I must give credit to everyone who is keeping the community spirit alive.</p>
<p>Today is a bank holiday in the UK, so all the British readers of the newsletter, enjoy your break with the newsletter. Rest of the world, start your week with weekly doses of Perl news. Stay safe and healthy.</p>       </div><!-- card-text -->     </div>

<p>While a set of regular expression would have done the job quite nicely I figured I’d use this problem as a reason to shake the rust off my grammar writing skills. Not that I am a master parser writer or anything, but <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Parse::Yapp">Parse::Yapp</a> makes it easy enough!</p>
<p>Well, easy is a bit relative I suppose. This is definitely not the simplest way of performing this task.</p>

<p>Similar to Part 1 this is also not the easiest way to perform this task. Here the same sort of recursion is used that is used in the <a href="http://www.rabbitfarm.com/cgi-bin/blosxom/prolog/2021/05/02">Prolog version</a> of the solution to this part. That is, we recurse over the table itself and then for each row perform a separate recursion to perform the transpostion.</p>

            </div> <!-- card-header -->
     <div class="card-body">       <div class="card-text">
   
     
     <p>The CAT would like to make some corrections, as well as address some of the comments and questions we received to the <a href="https://news.perlfoundation.org/post/cat-transparency-repor-19-april-2021">initial transparency report</a>. The CAT plans to publish a separate statement in the coming days relating to general changes and improvements to the process.</p>

<p>The subject of investigations #1 and #2, as referenced in the previous transparency report and below in this document, is the same and therefore will be known as the Subject throughout this document. The other individual mentioned in the previous transparency report is not mentioned except under the Corrections section.</p>

<p>There have been questions and concerns raised by members of the community regarding TPF CAT’s process in handling the incidents in question and our authority to sanction someone in response. We believe that this is within our authority for several reasons.</p>

<p>First, while TPF has never published a “year round” Standards of Conduct document, all TPF conferences have had a Standards of Conduct document (or equivalent) since YAPC in 2012 (Madison). The exact content of that document has varied over the years, though it’s been in something close to its current form for quite a number of years. The Subject has attended many of these conferences, and has agreed to these Standards of Conduct in the past as a matter of attending.</p>

<p>Second, the investigations we conducted and the sanctions we imposed in response are based on reports of harmful behavior by the Subject in multiple forums across a number of years. A subset of these were investigated in detail and reported on as investigation #1 and #2. While there are other reports, the results of both investigations combined were enough to take action.</p>

<p>Third, while some of the most recent behavior did not occur at a TPF event or in a TPF-controlled online space, we believe that the purpose of the CAT is primarily to protect people from harm in the spaces we do control. If someone demonstrates through their behavior that they are overwhelmingly likely to cause harm to the community in our events and spaces, we believe it is within our authority to impose sanctions on them because of that behavior in order to prevent future harm.</p>

<p>However, we do have a significant correction we want to make to the previous report in regards to authority. The initial report stated: “The CAT has instructed the Subject to leave and cease participation...” and went on to mention various online spaces that TPF <em>does not</em> control. This was not intended to be an instruction to take technical measures, but a request for the Subject to cease participation, and was done to prevent any further harm from occurring. However, we recognize that this was poorly worded, and we never intended to assert any control over these spaces. We recognize that these spaces are operated independently by various communities and each community must decide for themselves how to manage their community. The initial report further stated the CAT “may: explicitly extend the scope of the ban, take further technical measures”. TPF recognizes that this is out of scope.</p>

<p>In addition, there are a number of other corrections and clarifications we would like to make.</p>

<h2>Corrections</h2>

<ol>
<li>The ban from attending TPF conferences, events, and using TPF online chat platforms (Slack) stands. However:
<ol>
<li>This is modified to a minimum duration of 1 year.</li>
<li>The length of the ban is modified because having a year round Standards of Conduct is new, as is the CAT. Given all this, we felt it was fairer to start with a more limited sanction.</li>
<li>For the ban to be lifted, the Subject must agree to not repeat their past unacceptable behavior and agree to abide by the Standards of Conduct going forward.</li>
<li>Unacceptable behavior within that 1 year period could lead to an extension or modification of the length or the terms of the ban. This includes interactions between the Subject and others in the Perl and Raku communities, even outside of TPF events and online platforms.</li>
<li>For examples of unacceptable behavior, please see the current <a href="https://perlconference.us/tprc-2021-cloud/standards-of-conduct/">Standards of Conduct for the 2021 Conference in the Cloud</a>.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>The initial transparency report stated that warning would be issued to the second individual investigated as part of “investigation #1”.
<ol>
<li>The CAT apologizes and recognizes that this individual should not have been mentioned in the transparency report.</li>
<li>After reconsideration, it was decided that the warning is not appropriate based on the evidence in “investigation #1” and therefore will not be issued.</li>
<li>The CAT had a conversation with the second individual to discuss this.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>The CAT acknowledges it should have delayed the publication of the transparency report to give the Subject more time to respond.
<ol>
<li>The Subject disagrees with the extent of CAT’s assertion that the events of investigation #1 and #2 are part of a pattern of bad behavior.</li>
<li>The Subject disagrees with the level of harm this pattern of bad behavior causes the community.</li>
<li>The Subject is willing to leave or step down from their responsibilities within various online spaces, communities, and subcommunities if asked by the leaders or committees responsible for those online spaces, communities, or subcommunities.</li>
<li>The Subject does not commit to leaving other online spaces, communities, or subcommunities, except those which they have since been banned from.</li>
<li>The Subject accepts the ban on attending TPF conferences and events.</li>
</ol></li>
</ol>

<h2>Clarifications and responses to specific questions</h2>

<p>The CAT would like to address a few of the questions and comments it received on the last transparency report:</p>

<ol>
<li>The CAT wants to be clear that the behavior from investigation #1 alone would not have resulted in the CAT’s decision.
<ol>
<li>The events of “investigation #1” and “investigation #2” were investigated as a pattern of behavior which extends beyond the events of either investigation.</li>
<li>The CAT found that there was a pattern of bad behavior.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Regarding the event from “investigation #2”: whether the Subject willingly left or was given an ultimatum did not have any bearing on the CAT’s decision.</li>
<li>The community member who was harmed in investigation #1 is a different person than the community member harmed in investigation #2.</li>
<li>The second investigation was opened due to reports that there was a pattern of bad behavior. Aside from that, the investigations are not related.</li>
<li>Discriminatory statements need not be intended to attack nor directed at a specific person to cause harm.</li>
<li>As part of investigation #2, the CAT talked to multiple people who attended the event.</li>
<li>The CAT has subsequently provided a more detailed transparency report to the board of directors whilst respecting privacy of the subjects.
<ol>
<li>This more detailed version does not share the names of any parties of the investigations, but was deemed too detailed for public release.</li>
</ol></li>
</ol>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>The Community Affairs Team is committed to a safe environment, at conferences and physical events as well as online between members of the Perl and Raku community. If you have comments regarding this public statement you can send them to <a href="mail:cat@perlfoundation.org">cat@perlfoundation.org</a> with the word “comment” in the subject.</p>

<p>If you want to report: discriminatory, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior, please contact <a href="mail:cat@perlfoundation.org">cat@perlfoundation.org</a>. For examples of what may constitute unacceptable behavior, please see the Standards of Conduct for this year’s <a href="https://perlconference.us/tprc-2021-cloud/standards-of-conduct/">Conference in the Cloud</a>.</p>

<h2>Addenda</h2>

<p><strong>Update, 2021-05-07</strong>:  We've had a few people say that the paragraph about online spaces that TPF doesn't control was unclear.  We agree!  To clarify, the CAT doesn't provide unsolicited advice on how other spaces should run things, and the statement above should not be read as reserving the right to do so.</p>

            </div> <!-- card-header -->
     <div class="card-body">       <div class="card-text"><p>Today I was invited to join <a href="https://szabgab.com/">Gabor Szabo</a> for a <a href="https://code-maven.com/setting-up-ci-and-docker-for-course-management-app">live pair programming session</a>, where we worked on adding Docker and CI to his <a href="https://github.com/szabgab/course-management">course management application</a>. You can view the video of our informal competition who is the worst typist <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byugeGi1cNc">here</a>.</p>

<p>At first I was bit skeptical about the concept of live coding (who wants to watch people google^w code for two hours?), but in the end it was a funny and informative (for me) session. Maybe I'm just totally deprived of live human interaction (thanks, Corona), but I think I'd enjoy similar sessions also under normal circumstances.</p>

<h4>Things I learned</h4>

<ul>
<li>I forgot a lot of docker command line options after mostly using docker-compose.</li>
<li>There is no really smooth way to <code>COPY</code> a lot of dirs into the container.</li>
<li>Adding a <code>.dockerignore</code> file (to ignore at least <code>~/.git/</code>) saves some time and network, because docker will not send the ignored files to the docker daemon in the famous <code>sending build context to docker daemon</code> step at the start of each build.</li>
<li><code>-P</code> exposes the ports listed in <code>EXPOSE</code>, but maps them to random ports on the host (which makes no sense during dev, but probably when deploying to clouds)</li>
<li>Some people prefer <code>-ti</code>, some prefer <code>-it</code></li>
<li>I'm a bit rusty on using the github pull request workflow (esp. the part where you have to fetch upgrades from upstream), due to mostly working on repos where several devs have direct write access.</li>
<li>Setting up github CI is really not a lot of work (at least to only run the basic tests). Only <a href="https://github.com/szabgab/course-management/commit/2bfb424f8e1b14481def0886a198f4715cff5f8a">16 lines of <span class="caps">YAML</span></a>. I will try to add this to my <span class="caps">CPAN </span>github repos.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you're interested in the Dockerfile aspect of this session, may I point you to my talk <a href="/talks/writing_a_good_dockerfile_for_perl_app.html">Writing a good Dockerfile for a (Perl) app</a> from the 2020 Perl Conference, where I elaborate on some of the finer points, and with better preparation than today :-)</p>

<p>Oh, and this reminds me that I should submit a talk (maybe on docker-compose?) for <a href="https://perlconference.us/tprc-2021-cloud/">this years Perl &amp; Raku conference</a>. The CfP runs until tomorrow, so I better hurry.</p>       </div><!-- card-text -->     </div>

<p><em>[This article is part of our <a href="https://github.com/tpf/perldotcom/projects/1">Popular articles</a> project to update
Perl.com for contemporary practices]</em></p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re reading this article, you&rsquo;re likely looking for a simple way
to download and install the Perl programming language. Or you already
have Perl installed as part of your operating system, but it&rsquo;s older
than the currently-supported versions (5.32.1 or 5.30.3) and you&rsquo;d
like to use the latest and greatest features. <a href="https://www.perl.org/get.html">The download
options</a> may seem daunting, especially
if you&rsquo;re new to computers or programming. We&rsquo;ll take things step by
step, and soon you&rsquo;ll be on your way to writing your first Perl
program.</p>

<p>A word of warning, though: Several of these steps (and usually Perl
itself) require using your computer&rsquo;s command-line or terminal
interface.</p>

<h2 id="the-first-step-download-pre-built">The first step: Download pre-built</h2>

<p>If you&rsquo;re getting started in Perl development, you may only need a
pre-built binary distribution. Further on, though, you might want to
consider building your own, especially if you need to juggle different
versions to support different environments or want to use a later
version than is available pre-made.</p>

<p>For now, though, let&rsquo;s consider the pre-built options. You have
several, depending on what computer operating system you&rsquo;re using.</p>

<h3 id="microsoft-windows">Microsoft Windows</h3>

<p>The two main &ldquo;flavors&rdquo; of Perl for Windows are
<a href="https://www.activestate.com/products/perl/">ActiveState Perl</a> and
<a href="https://strawberryperl.com/">Strawberry Perl</a>. Which one you choose depends
on what you plan to use it for.</p>

<p><strong>ActiveState</strong> provides a
<a href="https://www.activestate.com/products/perl/downloads/">free community edition of ActivePerl</a>
licensed only for development purposes. If you intend to do
commercial work or want technical support beyond community forums, you&rsquo;ll
need to
<a href="https://www.activestate.com/solutions/pricing/">subscribe to a team plan or higher</a>.</p>

<p>The free community edition is also 64-bit only, and as of this writing, only
the earlier versions 5.28 (2018) and 5.26 (2017) are available, with an
experimental 5.32 (2020) release licensed for any purpose. The latter is
also currently only installable via the Windows command line; earlier
versions use a standard Windows setup wizard.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://strawberryperl.com/">Strawberry Perl</a></strong> is a Perl environment for
Windows that strives to be as close as possible to Perl on Unix and Linux
systems, where the language got its start. Besides the Perl binaries, it
also includes a compiler, related tools, external libraries, and database
clients. This is important as many modules for extending Perl&rsquo;s
functionality need a compiler. It&rsquo;s also available in both 64-bit and
32-bit editions of the current 5.32 version.</p>

<p><strong>What do I recommend?</strong> There&rsquo;s no escaping Perl&rsquo;s Unix heritage, so you&rsquo;ll
have an easier time with Strawberry Perl. That said, if you think you&rsquo;ll be
taking advantage of ActiveState&rsquo;s commercial offerings of support and their
<a href="https://www.activestate.com/products/platform/">ActiveState Platform</a> for
managing different language runtimes, you may want to give them a try.</p>

<p>Windows also has two Linux-like environments in the form of
<a href="https://www.cygwin.com/">Cygwin</a> and
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/">Windows Subsystem for Linux</a>.
Follow the Linux directions below to install Perl in one of these.</p>

<p>There is also the <a href="https://chocolatey.org/">Chocolatey</a> package manager for
Windows, which provides an option for installing either ActiveState or
Strawberry Perl.</p>

<h3 id="apple-macos">Apple macOS</h3>

<p>macOS comes with Perl pre-installed: version
5.18 (2013) on macOS Catalina 10.15 and 5.28 (2018) on Big Sur 11. But,
<a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/macos-release-notes/macos-catalina-10_15-release-notes#Scripting-Language-Runtimes">Apple has said that scripting language runtimes are deprecated</a>,
and are only &ldquo;included &hellip; for compatibility with legacy software.&rdquo; You
should consider installing your own.</p>

<p>Like Windows, ActiveState has a
<a href="https://www.activestate.com/products/perl/downloads/">free community edition</a>
for developers. The Windows caveats above apply, except for a current Perl
version 5.32—it&rsquo;s &ldquo;coming soon&rdquo; as of this writing.</p>

<p>Your best bet is to <a href="https://brew.sh/">install the Homebrew package manager</a>
in the macOS Terminal application (after
<a href="https://docs.brew.sh/Installation#macos-requirements">installing its requirements</a>),
and then issue the command <code>brew install perl</code>. This will install the latest
version of Perl, as well as give you instructions for making sure that
installed Perl modules stay that way across updates by Homebrew.</p>

<h3 id="linux-or-another-unix-like-system">Linux or another Unix-like system</h3>

<p>Like macOS, most Linux and Unix
systems come with Perl pre-installed, or installable using the operating
system&rsquo;s software package manager. Also like macOS, these are usually older
versions provided for compatibility with other software provided by the
OS.</p>

<p>To install your own on Linux, you can
<a href="https://www.activestate.com/products/perl/downloads/">go the ActiveState route</a>
as above, or also use the
<a href="https://docs.brew.sh/Homebrew-on-Linux">Homebrew package manager</a>. There are
<a href="https://docs.brew.sh/Homebrew-on-Linux#requirements">several requirements to install first</a>,
and then you can
<a href="https://brew.sh/">follow the directions for installing Homebrew</a> and issue
the command <code>brew install perl</code>.</p>

<p>For other Unix systems with an older version of Perl, I&rsquo;m afraid you&rsquo;re going
to have to build from source as detailed below.</p>

<h2 id="next-steps-building-your-own-with-perlbrew-or-plenv">Next steps: Building your own with perlbrew or plenv</h2>

<p>Perl&rsquo;s source code (the instructions that build a program) is freely
available and compiles on <a href="https://perldoc.pl/perlport#PLATFORMS">over 100
platforms</a>. You can <a href="https://www.perl.org/get.html">download
it directly</a> and build a version
yourself, after installing any prerequisite packages used to build
software on your operating system (see below). However, most Perl
developers choose to use a tool to automate that process and manage
different versions of Perl side-by-side. Enter
<a href="https://perlbrew.pl/">perlbrew</a>.</p>

<p>Perlbrew requires an already-installed system version of Perl, but it
can be as old as 5.8 (2002), which should cover most Linux and Unix
systems in use today. Once you&rsquo;ve installed your operating system&rsquo;s
build tools and followed the directions on <a href="https://perlbrew.pl/">the perlbrew home
page</a>, typing <code>perlbrew install 5.32.1</code> followed
by <code>perlbrew switch 5.32.1</code> will install and switch to the latest
version of Perl as of this writing. Installing older versions of Perl
and switching between them use the same steps, e.g.:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">perlbrew install <span style="color:#ae81ff">5</span>.30.3 --as older-perl
perlbrew switch older-perl</code></pre></div>
<p>I use an alternative, <a href="https://github.com/tokuhirom/plenv">plenv</a>,
which uses a different mechanism to manage versions of Perl using the <code>bash</code>
command shell. It also enables you to use different versions of Perl depending
on which file system directory you&rsquo;re working in. It&rsquo;s
<a href="https://github.com/tokuhirom/plenv/blob/master/README.md#installation">set up</a>
using either Homebrew or <code>git</code>.</p>

<p>Windows users have the option of
<a href="https://github.com/stevieb9/berrybrew">berrybrew</a>, which acts much like
perlbrew for Strawberry Perl with slightly different
<a href="https://github.com/stevieb9/berrybrew#commands">options</a>.</p>

<h2 id="building-from-the-source-directly">Building from the source directly</h2>

<p>If you feel you don&rsquo;t need to manage multiple installations of Perl or you
want to do things old-school, you can always download and build directly from
the source code. Select &ldquo;Download Latest Stable Source&rdquo; from the
<a href="https://www.perl.org/get.html">Perl Download</a> web page, then
<a href="https://opensource.com/article/17/7/how-unzip-targz-file">unarchive it</a>
into a directory.</p>

<p>You should always check the included <code>README</code> files for information on how to
build on your system; there&rsquo;s a generic one as well as specific <code>README</code>s for
various platforms (<code>README.linux</code>, <code>README.macosx</code>, <code>README.win32</code>, etc.).
Note that the <code>README.macosx</code> document applies to current versions of macOS,
which was previously called Mac OS X; <code>README.macos</code> is for the &ldquo;Classic&rdquo;
Macintosh operating system, unsupported since 2004.</p>

<p>On most Unix-like systems (including macOS), you can then configure, build,
test, and install Perl by issuing the following commands:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">./Configure -des -Dprefix<span style="color:#f92672">=</span>/usr/local/
make
make test
sudo make install</code></pre></div>
<p>This will build Perl with all default options for your system and install it
in the <code>/usr/local</code> directory.</p>

<h2 id="up-and-running">Up and running</h2>

<p>Regardless of whether you&rsquo;ve chosen to install a pre-built package or roll
your own, you should now be able to issue the following at your command line:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">perl -v</code></pre></div>
<p>&hellip;and receive a reply that looks something like this:</p>

<pre><code>This is perl 5, version 32, subversion 1 (v5.32.1) built for darwin-2level

<h3 id="notes-1">Notes</h3>
<p>This sort of problem practically screams out for a Prolog solution! In the interest of keeping with the name, if not the spirit of the weekly challenge, this first part is indeed Perl, albeit using AI::Prolog, a module which offers a pure Perl implementation of a basic Prolog.</p>
<p>I have used AI::Prolog <a href="https://adamcrussell.livejournal.com/14361.html">previously</a> and it’s a neat way to take advantage of Prolog within a Perl based solution. The two main downsides are that (1) it is not a full ISO Prolog and (2) it is slow. So very very slow. I suspect, in fact, there is a serious bug in the implementation. Even accounting for the fact that a pure Perl Prolog would be much slower than one written in C, such as Gnu Prolog, the execution time differences are laughably dramatic. I didn’t bother with precise metrics but the code above takes about an hour to run on fairly current hardware (i.e. my 2018 Mac Mini). Essentially the same code run on the same hardware but with Gnu Prolog completes in mere seconds.</p>
<p>Still, this is a nice way to incorporate a bit of Symbolic AI in a Perl code base if there is a small search space. Say, for some simple game logic or a small chat bot.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.rabbitfarm.com/cgi-bin/blosxom/prolog/2021/04/25">pure Prolog solution</a> I did for this uses the same approach, in part, although I also wrote this to take advantage of Gnu Prolog’s FD solver. The FD version of the code completes in about 10ms!</p>

<p>March didn't see me doing that many grant hours; I was keeping my keyboard time down for
the first half of the month, and then had a lot to catch up on in the second half (and
still needed to avoid putting in more than a usual working day). On the upside, the time
that was spent was productive: I got some way into implementing more of Raku's multiple
dispatch semantics in terms of the new dispatcher. I've written a <a href="https://6guts.wordpress.com/2021/04/15/raku-multiple-dispatch-with-the-new-moarvm-dispatcher/">blog post</a>
about that work (although some of the work it covers was done during April).</p>

     <div class="card-body">       <div class="card-text">
   
     
     <p>Following issues raised within the community, the CAT opened an investigation into community conduct. A second investigation was opened based on information discovered during the first investigation.</p>

<p>What follows constitutes our second transparency report as well as an additional conclusion statement by the CAT. If you have not read it already, we highly recommend you read our latest <a href="https://news.perlfoundation.org/post/cat-update-19-april-2021">Community Affairs Team Update</a>.</p>

<h1>Investigation #1</h1>

<p>Based on a recent public post viewed by the CAT, the CAT investigated two individuals for potentially unacceptable behavior over IRC and Twitter. The investigation found that the first individual continued communication on multiple platforms despite being asked repeatedly to stop. Past behavior by the first individual was discovered during the course of the investigation. The CAT opened a separate investigation into this past behavior, and that investigation’s results are explained as part of “Investigation #2”.</p>

<p>Regarding the second individual investigated as part of “Investigation #1”, the CAT has decided to issue them a warning. The CAT is in contact with them and has scheduled a meeting with them to discuss this.</p>

<h1>Investigation #2</h1>

<p>Based on the previous investigation, the CAT investigated past behavior by the first individual. The CAT found that as an attendee of a 2019 Perl event, they had made repeated discriminatory statements and arguments in a conversation with the target, which was also overheard by other attendees. The individual continued arguing for this position despite being asked repeatedly to stop, the next day there were asked to leave the event.</p>

<p>They were instructed not to repeat the discriminatory statements and arguments. They were told an apology should not be made to the target of the harassment. Later, the individual repeated the discriminatory statements publicly on Twitter in discussions with other members of the community which were also viewed by the target. The target told the individual not to contact them ever again. Despite being asked explicitly not to contact them, the individual later contacted the target by email, which was an additional instance of unacceptable behavior.</p>

<h1>Consequences</h1>

<p>The CAT has informed the individual investigated as part investigation #1 and #2 that they are banned from attending any Perl Foundation conferences or events in perpetuity.</p>

<p>The CAT has instructed the individual to leave and cease participation on any public IRC channels on irc.perl.org, leave and cease participation on the Perl and Raku public channels on Freenode, unsubscribe and cease participation on any Perl and Raku community mailing lists including but not limited to the perl5-porters mailing list. The CAT has informed them to not contact the targets of their behavior from “Investigation #1” or “Investigation #2”. The CAT has informed them to not repeat the offending statements or arguments from “Investigation #2”. If the CAT decides the letter or the spirit of this decision has been violated, it may: explicitly extend the scope of the ban, take further technical measures to ensure compliance, or take other actions as it deems necessary.</p>

<h1>Other findings</h1>

<p>In addition to the findings of both investigations, the CAT wants to make it clear that separate and inclusive of the two reported investigations, it found many instances of communication which alone may not have constituted unacceptable behavior, but when taken together did constitute unacceptable behavior. The CAT asks all members of the Perl community to be respectful of others and that discriminatory or harassing conduct will not be tolerated.</p>

<h1>Conclusion</h1>

<p>The Community Affairs Team is committed to a safe environment, at conferences and physical events as well as online between members of the Perl and Raku community. If you have comments regarding this public statement you can send them to <a href="mail:cat@perlfoundation.org">cat@perlfoundation.org</a> with the word “comment” in the subject. If you want to report: discriminatory, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior, including evasion of CAT decisions, please contact <a href="mail:cat@perlfoundation.org">cat@perlfoundation.org</a>. For examples of what may constitute unacceptable behavior, please see the Standards of Conduct for this year’s <a href="https://perlconference.us/tprc-2021-cloud/standards-of-conduct/">Conference in the Cloud</a>.</p>

     <p>The CAT’s purpose is to foster a positive and safe environment for anyone who shares an interest in Perl and Raku. </p>

<p>It has been one year since the Community Affairs Team <a href="https://news.perlfoundation.org/post/introducing-tpf-community-affairs-team">was first announced</a> in March of 2020.  In June, the Perl &amp; Raku Conference in the Cloud took place. This was <a href="https://perlconference.us/tpc-2020-cloud/">the first conference</a> where Community Affairs Moderators were present to respond to and handle Standards of Conduct violations. Prior to the conference, Community Affairs Moderators and <a href="https://perlconference.us/tpc-2020-cloud/handling-standards-of-conduct-incidents/">the CAT committee for the event</a> received training on handling and responding to SoC complaints within the community. A month later in July, the Chair of the CAT <a href="https://news.perlfoundation.org/post/board-2020-07">was appointed by the TPF board</a>. In October, the <a href="https://news.perlfoundation.org/post/cic-2020-soc-transparency-report">first Standards of Conduct transparency report</a> was released.</p>

<p>Following that, the CAT has been working on a charter document which outlines in more concrete terms its role and responsibilities as it relates to the community, as well as an updated Standards of Conduct which would apply not just to conferences, but to other TPF online spaces. Recent events in the community have expedited the CAT’s work and the board’s approval of these documents, which are planned to be publicly released within the next week.</p>

<p>The CAT is also preparing for the upcoming <a href="https://perlconference.us/tprc-2021-cloud/">Perl &amp; Raku Conference in the Cloud</a>, and training similar that received in 2020 is planned for the moderators and CAT committee for this event. The CAT thanks the many people who provided their input to the formation of the CAT, and Samantha McVey, Stuart Mackintosh, and Ricardo Signes for continuing their work on the CAT committee as well as their work on the CAT committee during last year’s conference. </p>

<p>The Community Affairs Team is committed to a safe environment, at conferences and physical events as well as online between members of the Perl and Raku community. If you have comments regarding this update you can send them to <a href="mail:cat@perlfoundation.org">cat@perlfoundation.org</a> with the word “comment” in the subject.</p>

<p>This is a somewhat unusual challenge for Perl. Sometimes these challenges allow for a certain amount of interpretation. For example, under the hood, the representation of Perl data in memory involves more complicated data structures. I think it is in the spirit of this challenge to demonstrate access to this, without necessarily implementing complete and fully generalized solution.</p>
<p>Here I use <code>Devel::Peek</code> in order to get a report on the underlying memory usage of the given variables. The <code>Dump</code> function only prints a memory report to STDERR, so in order to obtain the information we seek <code>Capture::Tiny</code> is used to encapsulate the STDERR output and save it to a variable. A regex is then used to pull out the memory address which is then printed.</p>
<p>The memory address printed here is the <em>reference address</em>. For additional details on Perl’s core see the perlguts documentation.</p>

<p>This is an interesting problem. At first glance one might be tempted to proceed and compute the partitions and then take the total number of them all. Instead, it turns out that there is a simpler closed form solution whereby we can compute the <em>Bell Triangle</em> and then take the values on the leftmost diagonal to be the <em>Bell Numbers</em> as required.</p>
<p>For fun the <a href="http://www.rabbitfarm.com/cgi-bin/blosxom/prolog/2021/04/18">Prolog solution</a> does indeed compute the partitions instead of simply using the Bell Triangle!</p>

<p>Getting a list of methods can <em>mostly</em> be done via just some plain analysis of the code. Rather than re-invent the wheel I am using a module, Perl::Analysis::Static, to do that for me. This is a pretty neat tool but has been left in an alpha state. The most stable way to use it is via the command line instead of its incomplete API. In this code I call the <code>perlanalyst</code> command and then parse the output.</p>
<p>If given a <code>BEGIN</code> block or if <code>use</code>-ing a module Perl will execute a <code>BEGIN</code> at compile time. <em>I would argue that this is out of scope for this challenge.</em> However, as given in the problem statement we are expected to catch this it seems. I do this by inspecting the <code>perlanalyst</code> output for <code>use</code> lines. I could have done a few other things as well but decided not to do more with this since it seems like a funny requirement anyway!</p>
