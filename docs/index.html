     <div class="card-body">       <div class="card-text"><p>Hi,</p>
<p>I just had a meeting with a company in the UK that were looking for some consulting in Perl. After our conversation I felt that what they are interested in is not really where my expertise is, so I referred them to two other people who have a lot more experience in those areas. However I realized I don't know who is providing consulting or development service these days. So let me know. Who knows next time I might be able to refer the clients to you.</p>
<p>On the other hand I just found out that my client, where I do some refactoring on a web-application with some machine-learning backend (written in Python). is likely to move the project to their parent company. This probably means I'll be free for other projects to introduce test automation, CI, and refactoring code.</p>

<p>I hoped to manage to put a working system together this weekend. (Currently

I'm hopeful to do so in the coming days.</p>

     <div class="card-body">       <div class="card-text"><p>I really enjoyed reading Mark Gardner's <a href="https://dev.to/mjgardner/lamp-is-dead-long-live-perl-web-frameworks-42g7">blog post about web frameworks</a> this week, but in one way it made me feel slightly sad.</p>

<p>It made me sad because it got me thinking about how a lot of Perl web development seems to be stuck in the past. Oh, don't get me wrong - I know that modern Perl web frameworks allow you to do anything that you could do with technologies like Node.js. But I don't know how widely-known that information is. If you spend much time reading the <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/perl">Perl questions</a> on Stack Overflow, you'll soon realise just how much Perl web development still consists of CGI programs running in a LAMP stack. For many of the people asking for help there, it seems that even using a templating engine to separate your HTML from your code is cutting-edge technology that they would rather avoid. And that means that other modern web technologies completely pass them by.</p>

<p>But there's no need for that at all. A lot of the coolest modern web technologies happen at the front-end, in the browser. And the browser doesn't care at all what technologies you're using at the back end. As long as the browser is given valid HTML, CSS and Javascript to work with, it doesn't matter if that was generated using Perl, Node.js or whatever other technology is trending this week.</p>

<p>So I thought it was worth writing a short series of articles demonstrating how you might do some clever-looking modern web development tricks using Perl at the back end. We'll start with in-place editing of data.</p>

<h2>
  <a href="#start-with-dancer2">
  </a>
  Start with Dancer2
</h2>

<p>I'll start with a basic <a href="https://perldancer.org/">Dancer2</a> application. Let's pretend we're a freelance developer of some kind and we have many projects for different clients in progress at the same time. At the basic level, you'd like to see what projects you are currently working on. A useful web page might look like this.</p>

<p><a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--bQCjbN01--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/kyumcbnjix5drxji6nnw.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--bQCjbN01--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/kyumcbnjix5drxji6nnw.png" alt="Basic client/project information"></a></p>

<p>Here we have two clients and there are two projects currently live for each of them.</p>

<p>This is a very basic Dancer2 application. There are two tables, called <code>client</code> and <code>project</code>. I've used <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Dancer2::Plugin::DBIC">Dancer2::Plugin::DBIC</a> to make it easy to access my database from my application. There's a single route that displays this page and the page has been made to look reasonably well-designed by using <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a>.</p>

<p>The Dancer code is trivial:</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>package APIDemo;
use Dancer2;
use Dancer2::Plugin::DBIC;

get '/' =&gt; sub {
  template 'index' =&gt; {
    title =&gt; 'APIDemo',
    clients =&gt; [ schema-&gt;resultset('Client')-&gt;all ],
  };
};

true;
</code></pre>

</div>

<p>And the relevant part of the template is just a couple of simple loops:</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>&lt;table class="table"&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;th&gt;Code&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;th&gt;Name&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;th&gt;Email&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;th&gt;Projects&lt;/th&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;% FOR client IN clients -%&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;% client.code %&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;% client.name %&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;% client.email %&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;
      &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;% FOR project IN client.projects -%&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;% project.code %&gt; / &lt;% project.name %&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;% END -%&gt;
      &lt;/ul&gt;
    &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;% END -%&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
</code></pre>

</div>
<h2>
  <a href="#inplace-editing">
  </a>
  In-place editing
</h2>

<p>So far, so good (I hope). But let's get a bit cleverer. I'm sure you've all seen web pages where you can edit text just by clicking on the page, changing the text and hitting a tick button to save your changes. Let's add that feature to this page.</p>

<p>A system like this needs two components:</p>

<ul>
<li>Some Javascript that gives the user an edit box when they click the text and then makes an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajax_(programming)">AJAX</a> call to a back-end API to save the changes</li>
<li>Some code at the back end that handles that AJAX call and saves the new data to the database</li>
</ul>

<p>Let's look at the back end first, because that's the Perl bit.</p>
<h2>
  <a href="#perl-at-the-back-end">
  </a>
  Perl at the back end
</h2>

<p>There are a couple of approaches to this. If you're a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer">REST API</a> purist, then you'll want to write PATCH endpoints for all of the resources that can be updated in this way. That's a good way to go, but you can end up writing a lot of very similar code. I took a different approach.</p>

<p>I wrote an API endpoint that expects to be given the type of object that is being updated - because that way the same code can be used for all of your updates. The code looks like this:</p>
<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>patch '/api/update_attribute' =&gt; sub {

  my $input = decode_json(request-&gt;content);

  my $rs = schema-&gt;resultset($input-&gt;{resultset});

  my $object = $rs-&gt;find($input-&gt;{id});

  if ($object) {
    $object-&gt;update($input-&gt;{update});
  }

  content_type('application/json');

  return 200;
};
</code></pre>

</div>

<p>Note that in a production system, you would probably want to keep your API in a separate application to your web site. As this is a simple example, they're both in the same application and I've just used the prefix <code>/api</code> for the API call.</p>

<p>The code isn't complicated though. We expect a JSON payload which we can decode to get access to our parameters. One parameter is the name of the resultset that we need to query and another is the ID of the actual object we're updating. Taking those together, we can use the resultset's <code>find()</code> method to get our object from the database. We expect the <code>update</code> parameter to be a hash mapping keys to new values that we can pass directly to the object's <code>update()</code> method. Our current example will only be updating one attribute at a time, but we've written future-proof code that can handle multiple attributes at the same time.</p>

<p>The code could be cleverer. Note that if we fail to find the object, we just skip the update. We should probably return 404 at that point. We also need to check that we're passed meaningful sets of parameters and take appropriate action if, for example, the resultset is missing. But this is enough for a proof of concept.</p>

<h2>
  <a href="#jquery-at-the-front-end">
  </a>
  jQuery at the front end
</h2>

<p>Now it's time to look at the front-end. I mentioned before that the web page was designed using Bootstrap. And one of the nice things about Bootstrap is that it uses <a href="https://jquery.com/">jQuery</a> for all of its front-end cleverness. So it's likely that a page that uses Bootstrap already loads the jQuery core library. We just need to look for an add-on that will support the feature that we need to add. A couple of minutes with Google led me to <a href="https://github.com/NicolasCARPi/jquery_jeditable/">jQuery-editable</a> which does everything we need.</p>

<p>Basically, jQuery-editable can be attached to any HTML element on your page. The approach recommended in the documentation is to add the class "editable" to any elements that you want to make editable. You can then use the Javascript document ready event to set up the plugin. Doing this in a document ready event is a pretty standard approach when using jQuery. I created a file called <code>apidemo.js</code> which is loaded in my main layout template and which contains this:</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>$( document ).ready(function() {

  $('.editable').editable(function(value, settings) {
    var data = {
      resultset: this.dataset.resultset,
      id:        this.dataset.id
    };

    var update = {};
    update[this.dataset.attribute] = value;

    data.update = update;

    var url = '/api/update_attribute';

    $.ajax({
      url: url,
      type: 'PATCH',
      data: JSON.stringify(data),
      success: function(data) {
        console.log(data);
      }
    });

    return(value);
  }, {
    submit: '&amp;check;',
    cancel: 'X',
    showfn : function(elem) { elem.fadeIn('slow') },
    cancelcssclass : 'btn btn-danger',
    submitcssclass : 'btn btn-success'
  });
});
</code></pre>

</div>

<p>Most of this is concerned with setting up the <code>editable()</code> function which gets called whenever the user edits the value in the HTML element.</p>

<p>We start by creating a <code>data</code> object that will be passed as the payload in our AJAX request. The first two attributes we set up in  the object are <code>resultset</code> and <code>id</code> which (as we saw in the Perl code) are used to find the correct database row to update. We get these values from the <code>dataset</code> attributes attached to the current HTML element. These are the <code>data-*</code> attributes that you might have seen in modern HTML. You can add any attributes you like to an HTML element and the value is readable from Javascript. This means that we need to alter our templates slightly so this information is added. For example, the <code>&lt;td&gt;</code> element around the client name would look like this:</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>&lt;td class="editable" data-resultset="Client"
    data-attribute="name" data-id="&lt;% client.id %&gt;"&gt;
  &lt;% client.name %&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
</code></pre>

</div>

<p>We've added the <code>class="editable"</code> so we can identify this as an editable element. We've also added the <code>data-resultset</code>, <code>data-attribute</code> and <code>data-id</code> attributes. Some of these values are hard-coded, but the <code>data-id</code> value comes from the client object that we're displaying on this row of the table.</p>

<p>So, we've put the resultset and id in the <code>data</code> object. We then create another object that maps the attribute name to the value that is passed to the function (which will be the new value of the attribute). By creating a Javascript object like this, we end up in the Perl code with a hash that can be passed directly to the <code>update()</code> (as we saw above). We then take this <code>update</code> object and store it in <code>data</code>.</p>

<p>The next step is to make the AJAX call that actually updates the database. We use <code>JSON.stringify()</code> to encode our <code>data</code> object into JSON (so that the Perl code can decode the JSON to a Perl data structure). We basically ignore the value returned from the AJAX call (just writing it to the console) but a more rigorous version of this code would want to look for and deal with any error responses.</p>

<p>The rest of the setup is cosmetic. We set the labels for the submit and cancel buttons and use the CSS options to give the buttons classes that Bootstrap will recognise. Finally, we've written a function that means the edit box will fade in slowly.</p>

<p>And that's it. Save all of the files, restart your Dancer app and reload it. Nothing will look different, but if you click on a client name you'll see this.</p>

<p><a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--zdiLWW_j--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/h0xbyxkvs1udrpa5oumy.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--zdiLWW_j--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/h0xbyxkvs1udrpa5oumy.png" alt="Editing a client's name"></a></p>

<p>You can then edit the name and when you submit the changes, they get saved to your database.</p>

<p>The nice thing about this approach is that, having set it all up, it's really easy to make it work for any other data item displayed on the page. You just need to add the <code>editable</code> class and the relevant <code>data-*</code> attributes.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/davorg/dancer-api-demo">code for this demo app is available on GitHub</a> and in that version you can edit the client name and email address, together with the project name.</p>

<p>I hope this starts to show you how you Perl can be used to build web apps that have all the bells and whistles that uses expect. If there's any particular modern web feature that you'd like to see me explore in this series, then let me know in the comments and I'll see what I can do.</p>

<p>You are given a positive integer $N.</p>

<p>So that wikipedia page has enough formulas to get a math nerd very excited. For me it looks a little to complex to understand. So I took a very simple approach. Start from one, and keep counting upwards while the square of the next number is equal or less to the input value.</p>

<p>This seems reasonably efficient for what we are doing. Even finding the integer square root of 10,000,000,000,000,000 only takes a few seconds.</p>

<p>This turned out to be a bit more complicated than I thought. I'm glad the Wikipedia page had examples, otherwise I would have submitted a faulty solution.</p>

<p>I have two functions for this task. The <code>_digit_sum</code> function takes a number, and calculates the sum of the digits. So 265 is 2 + 6 + 5 = 13. The second function is <code>_prime_factor_sum</code>. This gets the prime factors that make up the number. If the number is a prime, we return -1 to ensure equality is not matched. Once we have the primes we get the sum of the sum of the digits of the prime multipled by its factor. So 265 is 5¹ × 53¹. This results in 5 × 1 + (5 + 3) × 1 = 5 + 8 = 13.</p>

<p>Like with the first task, I have a counter that starts at 2 and keeps adding until I have found the first 10 Smith numbers. Once found, I display the numbers.</p>

<h2>Task 1: Integer Square Root</h2>

<p><em>You are given a positive integer <code>$N</code>.</em></p>

<p><em>Write a script to calculate the integer square root of the given number.</em></p>

<p><em>Please avoid using built-in function. Find out more about it <a href="here">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer_square_root</a>.</em></p>

<p><em>Examples:</em></p>

<pre><code>Input: $N = 10
Output: 3

Input: $N = 27
Output: 5

Input: $N = 85
Output: 9

Input: $N = 101
Output: 10
</code></pre>

<p>The standard method for calculating the square root of a number is the Newton method, a.k.a. Newton-Raphson method. For an integer square root, we may use a variation of that method called Heron&#8217;s method.</p>

<h3>Integer Square Root in Raku</h3>

<h4>Using a Bisection Method</h4>

<p>Before we implement the fairly fast standard method, let&#8217;s see what we can do with a bisection method, which is similar to a binary search algorithm on a list of values. If the input number is <code>$N</code>, then we look at the <code>1..$N</code> interval and find the midpoint <code>$est</code> as the first estimate of the square root. If the square of the midpoint is larger than <code>$N</code>, then we continue with the <code>1..$est</code> interval, else we continue with the <code>$est..$N</code> interval. We continue until the range is smaller than or equal to 1.</p>

<p>This is an implementation of this idea:</p>

<pre><code>use v6;

sub sqroot (Int $a) {
    # Bisection approach
    my $start = 1;
    my $end = $a;
    my $est;
    loop {
        $est = ($start + $end) div 2;
        say "\tIntermediate values: $start, $est, and $end";
        my $est-sq = $est ** 2;
        last if abs($end-$start) &lt;= 1;
        if $est ** 2 &gt; $a {
            $end = $est;
        } else {
            $start = $est;
        }
    }
    return $est;
}
say "$_\t", sqroot $_ for 10, 27, 85, 101, 200_000_000;
</code></pre>

<p>This program displays the following output:</p>

<p>This works well, but isn&#8217;t very efficient because our first estimates of the square root are quite far away from the actual root. We can improve the process significantly by starting the process with an estimate which is much closer to the target. For example, we can use <code>2 ** (((log2 N)/2).Int + 1)</code>, which is the least power of 2 larger than the square root of <code>N</code>, as our first estimate. This improved version may look like this:</p>

<pre><code>sub sqroot (Int $a) {
    # Bisection approach
    my $start = 1;
    my $end = $a;
    my $est = 2 ** (((log2 $a)/2).Int + 1);
    loop {
        say "\tIntermediate values: $start, $est, and $end";
        last if abs($end-$start) &lt;= 1;
        if $est ** 2 &gt; $a {
            $end = $est;
        } else {

<h4>Using Heron&#8217;s Method</h4>

<p>This method looks iteratively for a solution to the <code>x² - N = 0</code> equation. With Newton&#8217;s method which applies to general numbers (not only integers), if you start with almost any estimate, <code>p</code>, you can compute a better estimate <code>q</code> with the following formula: <code>q = (p + a / x) / 2</code>. Geometrically, this is like drawing a tangent to the curve at the point where the abscissa is the first estimate, and take the point where the tangent meets the <code>x</code> axis as the new estimate. As it can be seen, we quickly get closer to the searched value (the square root), which is where the curve intersects the x-axis.</p>

<p><img alt="Newton_method.jpg" src="http://blogs.perl.org/users/laurent_r/Newton_method.jpg" width="425" height="269" class="mt-image-none" style="" /></p>

<p>For integer square roots, we essentially need to replace standard rational division by Euclidean division (or integer division). </p>

<p>We use again <code>2 ** (((log2 N)/2).Int + 1)</code> as our first estimate (see above).</p>

<pre><code>use v6;

sub sqroot (Int $a) {
    my $x = 2 ** (((log2 $a)/2).Int + 1);
    my $y;
    loop {
        say "\tIntermediate value: $x";
        $y = ($x + $a div $x) div 2;
        last if abs($x - $y) &lt; 1;
        $x = $y;
    }
    return $y;
}
say "$_\t", sqroot $_ for 10, 27, 85, 101, 200_000_000;
</code></pre>

<p>This program displays the following output:</p>

<pre><code>$ raku ./int_sqrt.raku
    Intermediate value: 4
    Intermediate value: 3
10  3
    Intermediate value: 8
    Intermediate value: 5

</code></pre>

<p>As it can be seen, this method converges toward the root much faster than the bisection method.</p>

<h3>Integer Square Root in Perl</h3>

<h4>Using a Bisection Method</h4>

<p>We again start with a bisection method. Please refer to the Bisection Method sub-section in the Raku section above for further explanations. </p>

<p>Perl doesn&#8217;t have a <code>div</code> Euclidean division operator, but it is easy to replace it with a combination of the standard division operator <code>/</code> and the <code>int</code> built-in function. Similarly, there is no built-in <code>log2</code> binary logarithm function in Perl, but we can easily do without it, since we have the following mathematical property: <code>log2 x = log x / log 2</code> (where <code>log</code> is the logarithm in any base, including the natural or the decimal logarithm).</p>

<pre><code>use strict;
use warnings;
use feature "say";

sub sqroot {
    # Bisection method
    my $c = shift;
    my $start = 1;
    my $end = $c;
    my $est = 2 ** (int((log($c)/log(2))/2) + 1);
    while (1) {
        say "\tIntermediate values: $start, $est, and $end";
        last if abs($end-$start) &lt;= 1;
        if ($est ** 2 &gt; $c) {
            $end = $est;
        } else {
            $start = $est;
        }
        $est = int (($end + $start) / 2);
    }
    return $est;
}
say "$_\t", sqroot $_ for 85, 101, 200_000_000;
</code></pre>

<p>This script displays the same output as the equivalent Raku script above, so, for brevity, we only show the beginning of the output:</p>

<h2>Task 2: Smith Numbers</h2>

<p><em>Write a script to generate first 10 Smith Numbers in base 10.</em></p>

<p><em>According to <a href="Wikipedia">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smith_number</a>, in number theory, a Smith number is a composite number for which, in a given number base, the sum of its digits is equal to the sum of the digits in its prime factorization in the given number base.</em></p>

<h3>Smith Numbers in Raku</h3>

<p>For this task, we use a <code>prime-factors</code> subroutine that performs a prime factorization of the input parameter. We then iterates over successive integers (except those that are prime) and push the integer on a <code>@result</code> array if the sum of its digits is equal to the sum of the digits of its prime factors</p>

<pre><code>use v6;

my @primes = grep {.is-prime}, 1..*;

sub prime-factors (UInt $num-in) {
    my @factors;
    my $num = $num-in;
    for @primes -&gt; $div {
        while ($num %% $div) {
            push @factors, $div;
            $num div= $div;
        }
        return @factors if $num == 1;
    }
    push @factors, $num unless $num == $num-in;
    return @factors;
}

my @result;
my $count = 0;
for 1..* -&gt; $i {
    next if $i.is-prime; # we want composite numbers only
    my @factors = prime-factors $i;
    push @result, $i and ++$count if (|@factors).comb.sum == $i.comb.sum;
    last if $count &gt;= 10;
}
say @result;
</code></pre>

<p>This program displays the following output:</p>

<pre><code>$ raku ./smith_nums.raku
[4 22 27 58 85 94 121 166 202 265]
</code></pre>

<h3>Smith Numbers in Perl</h3>

<p>This is essentially the same algorithm as in Raku, except that we have to build our own <code>prime-factors</code> and <code>add_digits</code> subroutines and implement a loop to populate the <code>@primes</code> array.</p>

<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/perl
use strict;
use warnings;
use feature qw/say/;
use Data::Dumper;
use constant MAX =&gt; 400;

my @primes = (2, 3, 5, 7);
my $current = 9;
while (1) {
    my $prime = 1;
    for my $i (@primes) {
        my $i_sq = $i * $i;
        last if $i_sq &gt; $current;
        $prime = 0, last if $current % $i == 0;  
    }
    push @primes, $current if $prime;;
    $current += 2;
    last if $current &gt; MAX;
}
my %primes = map { $_ =&gt; 1} @primes;

sub prime_factors {
    my $num = shift;
    my $origin_num = $num;
    my @factors;
    for my $div (@primes) {
        while ($num % $div == 0) {
            push @factors, $div;
            $num /= $div;
        }
        return @factors if $num == 1;
    }
    push @factors, $num unless $num == $origin_num;
    return @factors;
}

sub add_digits {
my $sum = 0;
    for my $i (@_) {
        $sum += $_ for split //, $i;
    }
    return $sum;
}
# say join " ", prime_factors $_ for grep {not exists $primes{$_}} 2..50;

my @result;
my $count = 0;
my $i = 2;
while (1) {
    $i++;
    next if exists $primes{$i}; # we want composite numbers only
    my @factors = prime_factors $i;
    push @result, $i and $count++ if add_digits($i) == add_digits(@factors);
    last if $count &gt;= 10;
}
say "@result";

<h1>Raku Dispatch and Compiler Improvements Grant Update</h1>

<p>During September, I completed the remaining hours on <a href="https://news.perlfoundation.org/post/grant_proposal_raku_dispatch_compiler_improvements">my current grant</a>.
The key aim of the grant - to bring my work on a new generalized dispatch mechanism to the point where it
could be merged and delivered to Raku users - has been achieved, the merge taking place on 29th September.
I wrote a <a href="https://6guts.wordpress.com/2021/09/29/the-new-moarvm-dispatch-mechanism-is-here/">blog post</a>
that provides some data on the improvements, as well as identifying future work that can build upon what
has been achieved thus far.</p>

<p>During September, working under the grant, I:</p>

<ul>
<li>Implemented specialization and inlining of dispatches that store resume initialization state, to allow
the dispatches to be resumed (for example, if <code>callsame</code> is used). This was a critical part of getting
back the level of inlining for method calls and multi dispatches that existed prior to this work, which
is a critical factor in Raku performance.</li>
<li>Implemented caller-side removal of <code>Scalar</code> containers, which in turn avoids various duplicate guards,
leading to much tighter code being produced after specialization and JIT compilation in many common
situations.</li>
<li>Fixed <code>Junction</code> multi-dispatch failover for the case where the <code>Junction</code> was in a named argument,
along the way tweaking the semantics to be more consistent with those of positional arguments (there
were some unintended discrepancies in the previous implementation).</li>
<li>Changed dispatch program compilation to not emit type guards when the types were already proven during
optimization, rather than adding them and relying on them to be optimized out later.</li>
<li>Reinstated all known missing optimizations from prior to the new dispatch work, and added JIT support
for various new operations introduced during the work.</li>
<li>Did various modifications to improve startup time, which has regressed. The new dispatch model has
many advantages, however does carry a higher warmup cost.</li>
<li>Fixed the profiler to work again in programs that use continuations, after changes to the continuation
representation as part of callstack changes.</li>
<li>Did numerous smaller fixes for bugs identified by <code>blin</code> (which runs the tests of all modules in the
ecosystem). In some cases where the modules relied on internals or unspecified behavior, I sent a PR
to the module instead.</li>
</ul>

<p>The time worked during September was 55 hours and 18 minutes, which was the remaining grant time
available.</p>

        <p><cite>Look, that's why there's rules, understand? So that you </cite>think<cite> before you break 'em.</cite> &mdash; Terry Pratchett, in <u>Thief of Time</u>.</p>

<p>A couple installments into this series of blog posts, I realized an introduction to Perl warnings would be appropriate, with some words on how to turn them off, and why you probably do not want to. Yes, this should have been the first post in the series, but I didn't know it would actually <strong>be</strong> a series, and, well, maybe better late than never.</p>

<p>The Perl compiler/interpreter can emit warnings when it finds things that may indicate a problem with the code. These are <strong>not</strong> (yet) enabled by default, but experience has shown that enabling them can highlight conceptual and logic errors.</p>

<p>Back in the early days of Perl 5, these were enabled using the <code>-w</code> command-line option, or by setting the <code>$^W</code> variable to a true value. But this mechanism had two drawbacks: it was all-or nothing, and it was global in scope. Certainly the value of <code>$^W</code> could be localized, but localization does not prevent a called module from seeing changes made by its caller.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://perldoc.perl.org/warnings.html"><code>warnings</code></a> pragma, first released in Perl <code>5.6.0</code>, addresses both these problems. As of Perl <code>5.34.0</code> it provides 75 warning categories which can be specified individually. Unfortunately the documentation for this pragma contains only the names of the categories; their descriptions are mixed into <a href="http://perldoc.perl.org/perldiag.html"><code>perldiag</code></a>.</p>

<p>Because it is a pragma, the effects of <code>use warnings;</code> are lexical in scope: from the point of use to the most-local enclosing right curly bracket (or the end of the file if none), but <strong>not</strong> leaking into called modules.</p>

<p><code>use warnings;</code> (without listing any warning categories) enables all warnings. The warnings have proven so useful that this line of Perl is extremely common boilerplate at or near the beginning of a Perl source file. This might actually be the default behavior by now, except for concern about the effect on legacy code.</p>

<p>For example: a Perl scalar can take on an undefined value (<code>undef</code>), and in fact it has this value when first created. The results of operating on the undefined value are well-defined: the empty string in string context, zero in numeric context, and false in Boolean context. But since <code>undef</code> <strong>is</strong> the default value, if you try to operate on it, is the attempt deliberate, or did you forget to assign a value (or assign it to the wrong variable)? Perl can not resolve this, so the safe thing is to issue a warning, and let the programmer figure it out.</p>

<p>The thing is, maybe the programmer intended to make use of this behavior, in which case the warning is unwanted noise, and needs to be turned off. No problem: <code>no warnings 'uninitialized';</code> is the Perlish way to say "I meant to do that!" in this circumstance.</p>

<p>And now we come to the point of the quote that started this post: just because you <strong>can</strong> turn off a specific warning (or all of them) does not mean that you <strong>should</strong>, at least not without understanding why it is generated and why it is or is not relevant to your case. If you do elect to turn off a warning, it is best to turn it off in the smallest practical scope. After all, it is the nature of code to grow; disabling warnings in a larger scope provides more places for changes to introduce bugs &mdash; bugs that Perl's warnings might have alerted you to had they not been disabled. <cite>Caveat coder.</cite></p>

<p><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/javascript">JavaScript</a>/<a href="https://nodejs.org">Node.js</a> options dominated the four-letter acronyms as expected, but the fifth one surprised me: LAMP, the combination of the <a href="https://www.kernel.org/"><strong>L</strong>inux</a> operating system, <a href="https://httpd.apache.org/"><strong>A</strong>pache web server</a>, <a href="https://www.mysql.com/"><strong>M</strong>ySQL</a> relational database, and <a href="https://www.perl.org/"><strong>P</strong>erl</a>, <a href="https://www.php.net/"><strong>P</strong>HP</a>, or <a href="https://www.python.org/"><strong>P</strong>ython</a> programming languages. A <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=top+web+development+stacks">quick web search</a> for similar lists <a href="https://www.octalsoftware.com/blog/best-web-development-stacks">yielded</a> <a href="https://enkonix.com/blog/web-development-stacks">similar</a> <a href="https://dzone.com/articles/7-top-web-development-technology-stacks-for-2021">results</a>. Clearly, this meme (in the <a href="https://richarddawkins.net/2014/02/whats-in-a-meme/">Dawkins sense</a>) has outlasted <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010304112803/http://www.onlamp.com/pub/a/onlamp/2001/01/25/lamp.html">its popularization by tech publisher O’Reilly</a> in the 2000s.</p>

<p>Originally coined in 1998 during the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot-com_bubble">“dot-com” bubble</a>, I had thought that the term “LAMP” had faded with developers in the intervening decades with the rise of language-specific web frameworks for:</p>

<ul>
<li>Perl (e.g., <a href="http://www.catalystframework.org/">Catalyst</a>, <a href="https://www.perldancer.org/">Dancer</a>, <a href="https://mojolicious.org/">Mojolicious</a>),</li>
<li>PHP (e.g., <a href="https://laravel.com/">Laravel</a>, <a href="https://symfony.com/">Symfony</a>, <a href="https://getlaminas.org/">Zend/Laminas</a>),</li>
<li>and Python (e.g., <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a>, <a href="https://flask.palletsprojects.com/">Flask</a>, <a href="http://web2py.com/">web2py</a>).</li>
</ul>

<p>Certainly on the Perl side (with which I’m most familiar), the community has long since <a href="https://perldoc.perl.org/perlfaq9#Should-I-use-a-web-framework?">recommended the use of a framework</a> built on the <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/PSGI">PSGI</a> specification, <a href="https://www.perl.com/article/perl-and-cgi/#why-not-to-use-cgi">deprecating 1990s-era CGI</a> scripts and the <a href="https://perl.apache.org/">mod_perl Apache extension</a>. Although general-purpose web servers like Apache or <a href="https://nginx.org/">Nginx</a> may be part of an overall system, they’re typically used as <a href="https://docs.mojolicious.org/Mojolicious/Guides/Cookbook#Nginx">proxies</a> or load balancers for Perl-specific servers either <a href="https://docs.mojolicious.org/Mojo/Server/Hypnotoad">provided by the framework</a> or a <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Dancer2::Manual::Deployment#Running-on-PSGI-based-Perl-webservers">third-party module</a>.</p>

<p>Granted, PHP <a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/install.php">still relies</a> on web server-specific modules, APIs, or variations of the <a href="https://fastcgi-archives.github.io/">FastCGI protocol</a> for interfacing with a web server. And Python web applications typically make use of its <a href="https://wsgi.readthedocs.io/">WSGI protocol</a> either as a web server extension or, like the Perl examples above, as a <a href="https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/deploying/wsgi-standalone/#proxy-setups">proxied</a> <a href="https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/deploying/wsgi-standalone/">standalone server</a>. But all of these are deployment details and do little to describe how developers implement and extend a web application’s structure.</p>

<p>Note how the various four-letter JavaScript stacks (e.g., MERN, MEVN, MEAN, PERN) differentiate themselves mostly by frontend framework (e.g., <a href="https://angular.io/">Angular</a>, <a href="https://reactjs.org/">React</a>, <a href="https://vuejs.org/">Vue.js</a>) and maybe by the (relational or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NoSQL">NoSQL</a>) database (e.g., <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/">MongoDB</a>, MySQL, <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL</a>). All however seem standardized on the Node.js runtime and <a href="http://expressjs.com/">Express</a> backend web framework, which could, in theory, be replaced with non-JavaScript options like the more mature LAMP-associated languages and frameworks. (Or if you prefer languages that don’t start with “P”, there’s <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/">C#</a>, <a href="https://golang.org/">Go</a>, <a href="https://www.oracle.com/java/">Java</a>, <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/">Ruby</a>, etc.)</p>

<p><strong>My point is that “LAMP” as the name of a web development stack has outlived its usefulness.</strong> It’s at once too specific (about operating system and web server details that are often abstracted away for developers) and too broad (covering three separate programming languages and not the frameworks they favor). It also leaves out other non-JavaScript back-end languages and their associated frameworks.</p>

<p>The question is: what can replace it? I’d propose “NoJS” as reminiscent of “NoSQL,” but that inaccurately excludes JavaScript from its necessary role in the front-end. “NJSB” doesn’t exactly roll off the tongue, either, and still has the same ambiguity problem as “LAMP.”</p>

<p>How about pithy sort-of-acronyms patterned like <em>database-frontend-backend</em>? Here are some Perl examples:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>MRDancer</strong>: MySQL, React, and Dancer (I use this at <a href="https://www.hostgator.com/">work</a>. Yes, the M could also stand for MongoDB. <a href="https://www.karlton.org/2017/12/naming-things-hard/">Naming things is hard.</a>)</li>
<li>
<strong>MRMojo</strong>: MongoDB, React, and Mojolicious</li>
<li>
<strong>PACat</strong>: PostgreSQL, Angular, and Catalyst</li>
<li>etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>Ultimately it comes down to community and industry adoption. If you’re involved with back-end web development, please let me know in the comments if you agree or disagree that “LAMP” is still a useful term, and if not, what should replace it.</p>

When we say we read from a file or write to a file in Perl (or any other language for that matter), we don't actually access the file directly and immediately. Instead of that we what we really do is that we ask the operating system to read from the file or write to the file using a "system call". The Operating system (Linux, OSX, Windows, etc.) will do the work on our behalf, but it will try to optimize.
<p>
So it won't go and write to the disk immediately when we ask it to write a few characters. Instead of that it will keep the request in memory in a "buffer" and will write it to the disk later, when the buffer is full or when the file is closed.

     <div class="card-body">       <div class="card-text"><p>Hi there</p>
<p>Have you joined the annual <a href="https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com">Hacktoberfest 2021</a> run by Digital Ocean?</p>
<p>If not then please join without any further delay. Hacktoberfest encourages participation in the open source community. You can earn a limited edition T-shirt by completing the challenge.</p>
<p>Not sure if you noticed, but this time they have made an interesting change by allowing open source maintainers to also take part in the contest. Ever since I started <a href="https://theweeklychallenge.org">The Weekly Challenge</a>, I have hardly found time to dedicate to Hacktoberfest. Last year I could only submit 6 PRs, enough to win the contest, since you only need to submit 4 PRs. This year, I am only taking part as the maintainer of an open source project - "The Weekly Challenge". The best year for me as contributor was 2019 when I submitted 160 PRs.</p>
<p>If you are looking for an open source project to contribute to then you can join "The Weekly Challenge" and win the competition by submitting 4 PRs in just one week.</p>
<p>How?</p>
<p>Well, you could submit 2 Perl and 2 Raku solutions to the weekly task. Just submit one solution per PR. I know it is cheating but a fair one in my humble opinion. Again, please don't limit yourself to just Perl and Raku. You are free to choose your favourite programming language. One more bit, please don't tie yourself to the current weekly challenge. You are free pick any past week challenges. Plenty of choices available. If you have any questions with regard to submitting a PR then please follow the <a href="https://theweeklychallenge.org/blog/how-to-contribute">blog post</a> that explains every detail. If you still have any questions then please get in touch with me. You can find my details on the page. I am also accepting PRs to another open source project - <a href="https://github.com/manwar/theweeklychallenge">The Weekly Challenge</a> website which is also open source code.</p>
<p>If you are a CPAN contributor then you could pick and choose your favourite distribution and contribute. However there is a catch, the distribution may or may not be part of the contest. Having said that, you can contribute to my <a href="https://metacpan.org/author/MANWAR">CPAN distributions</a> if you fancy. I promise, I will make the distribution to be part of the contest so that your PR will count towards the target. Just yesterday, I received a <a href="https://github.com/manwar/BankAccount-Validator-UK/pull/2">Pull Request</a> on one of my CPAN distributions, <a href="https://metacpan.org/dist/BankAccount-Validator-UK">BankAccount::Validator::UK</a>.</p>

<p><em>Dave Cross has built cool <a href="https://davorg.dev/mirroryear">site</a> that does something similar.</em></p>

<p><em>Assuming today is 2021/09/22.</em></p>

<p><em>Example 1:</em></p>

<pre><code>Input: 2021/09/18
Output: 2021/09/14, 2021/09/26

On the date you were born, someone who was your current age, would have been born on 2021/09/14.
Someone born today will be your current age on 2021/09/26.
</code></pre>

<p><em>Example 2:</em></p>

<pre><code>Input: 1975/10/10
Output: 1929/10/27, 2067/09/05

On the date you were born, someone who was your current age, would have been born on 1929/10/27.
Someone born today will be your current age on 2067/09/05.
</code></pre>

<p><em>Example 3:</em></p>

<pre><code>Input: 1967/02/14
Output: 1912/07/08, 2076/04/30

On the date you were born, someone who was your current age, would have been born on 1912/07/08.
Someone born today will be your current age on 2076/04/30.
</code></pre>

<p>Even though I did the task a few days later, I&#8217;ll also assume today is 2021/09/22 in order to be able to compare my results with the examples provided in the task description.</p>

<h3>Mirror Dates in Raku</h3>

<p>Raku has rich built-in classes and/or roles (types) for dealing with dates. Here we only need to use the <code>Date</code> built-in data type. Date subtraction correctly computes the number of days between two dates, leading to very simple code:</p>

<pre><code>use v6;

my $today =  Date.new("2021-09-22");
for "2021-09-18", "1975-10-10", "1967-02-14" -&gt; $test {
    my $input = Date.new($test);
    my $time-diff = $today - $input;
    say "Mirror dates for $input are: ", 
        $input - $time-diff, " and ", $today + $time-diff;
}
</code></pre>

<p>This program displays the following output:</p>

<pre><code>$ raku ./mirror-dates.raku
Mirror dates for 2021-09-18 are: 2021-09-14 and 2021-09-26
Mirror dates for 1975-10-10 are: 1929-10-27 and 2067-09-05
Mirror dates for 1967-02-14 are: 1912-07-08 and 2076-04-30
</code></pre>

<h3>Mirror Dates in Perl</h3>

<p>As usual, I don&#8217;t want, for a programming challenge, to use external modules. So I&#8217;ll be using only the core <code>Time::Local</code> module. This leads to some complexities compare to the Raku version. In particular, the program has a <code>compute_time</code> function to transform a date string into a standard Posix time stamp, and a <code>convert_date</code> function to perform the reciprocal conversion (time stamp to string). Besides that, the Perl program works the same way as the Raku program.</p>

<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/perl
use strict;
use warnings;
use feature qw/say/;
use Time::Local;

sub compute_time {
    my ($y, $mo, $d) = split /-/, shift;
    my ($h, $mi, $s) = (0, 0, 0);
    $mo -= 1; # months are 0-indexed
    # $y -= 1900; # timegm works better with real year
    # say $y;
    return timegm($h, $mi, $s, $d, $mo, $y);
} 
sub convert_date {
    my $time_stamp = shift;
    my ($d, $m, $y) = (gmtime $time_stamp)[3, 4, 5];
    $d = sprintf "%02d", $d;
    $m = sprintf "%02d", $m+1;
    $y += 1900;
    return "$y-$m-$d";
}

my $today =  compute_time("2021-09-22");  # timestamp for the date arbitrarily chosen as "today"
for my $test ("2021-09-18", "1975-10-10", "1967-02-14") {
    my $input = compute_time ($test);
    my $time_diff = $today - $input;
    my @output = ($input - $time_diff, $today + $time_diff);
    say "Mirror dates for $test are: ", convert_date($output[0]), " and ", convert_date($output[1]);
}
</code></pre>

<p>This program displays the following output:</p>

<pre><code>$ perl ./mirror-dates.pl
Mirror dates for 2021-09-18 are: 2021-09-14 and 2021-09-26
Mirror dates for 1975-10-10 are: 1929-10-27 and 2067-09-05
Mirror dates for 1967-02-14 are: 1912-07-08 and 2076-04-30

<h2>Task2: Hash Join</h2>

<p><em>Write a script to implement Hash Join algorithm as suggested by <a href="Wikipedia">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_join#Classic_hash_join</a>.</em></p>

<ol>
<li>For each tuple r in the build input R
1.1 Add r to the in-memory hash table
1.2 If the size of the hash table equals the maximum in-memory size:
    1.2.1 Scan the probe input S, and add matching join tuples to the output relation
    1.2.2 Reset the hash table, and continue scanning the build input R</li>
<li>Do a final scan of the probe input S and add the resulting join tuples to the output relation</li>
</ol>

<p><em>Example:</em></p>

<pre><code>Input:

    @player_ages = (
        [20, "Alex"  ],
        [28, "Joe"   ],
        [38, "Mike"  ],
        [18, "Alex"  ],
        [25, "David" ],
        [18, "Simon" ],
    );

    @player_names = (
        ["Alex", "Stewart"],
        ["Joe",  "Root"   ],
        ["Mike", "Gatting"],
        ["Joe",  "Blog"   ],
        ["Alex", "Jones"  ],
        ["Simon","Duane"  ],
    );

Output:

    Based on index = 1 of @players_age and index = 0 of @players_name.

    20, "Alex",  "Stewart"
    20, "Alex",  "Jones"
    18, "Alex",  "Stewart"
    18, "Alex",  "Jones"
    28, "Joe",   "Root"
    28, "Joe",   "Blog"
    38, "Mike",  "Gatting"
    18, "Simon", "Duane"
</code></pre>

<p>I don&#8217;t quite understand the relationship between hash join algorithm as described in the Wikipedia article and the example provided. So, I&#8217;ll simply try to replicate the behavior described in the example.</p>

<h3>Hash Join in Raku</h3>

<p>The input is the two arrays of arrays (AoA), <code>@player_ages</code> and <code>@player_names</code>, provided in the task description example. We load <code>@player_names</code> into the <code>%names</code> hash of arrays (HoA). Then we loop over the other input array, <code>@player_ages</code> and look up the hash to complete the lines, which we eventually print out.</p>

<pre><code>use v6;

my @player_ages = 
    [20, "Alex"  ],
    [28, "Joe"   ],
    [38, "Mike"  ],
    [18, "Alex"  ],
    [25, "David" ],
    [18, "Simon" ];

my @player_names = 
    ["Alex", "Stewart"],
    ["Joe",  "Root"   ],
    ["Mike", "Gatting"],
    ["Joe",  "Blog"   ],
    ["Alex", "Jones"  ],
    ["Simon","Duane"  ];

my %names;
for @player_names -&gt; $name {
    push %names{$name[0]}, $name[1];
}
for @player_ages -&gt; $pl_age {
    my ($age, $first_name) = $pl_age;
    next unless %names{$first_name}:exists;
    # say "$age  $first_name";
    for %names{$first_name}[] -&gt; $name {
        say "$age $first_name $name";
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>This script displays the following output:</p>

<pre><code>raku ./hash-join.raku
20 Alex Stewart
20 Alex Jones
28 Joe Root
28 Joe Blog
38 Mike Gatting
18 Alex Stewart
18 Alex Jones
18 Simon Duane
</code></pre>

<h3>Hash Join in Perl</h3>

<p>The Perl version is essentially a port to Perl of the Raku version above. Please refer to the explanations above if needed.</p>

<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/perl
use strict;
use warnings;
use feature qw/say/;
use Time::Local;

my @player_names = (
    ["Alex", "Stewart"],
    ["Joe",  "Root"   ],
    ["Mike", "Gatting"],
    ["Joe",  "Blog"   ],
    ["Alex", "Jones"  ],
    ["Simon","Duane"  ],
    );

my %names;
for my $name (@player_names) {
    push @{$names{$name-&gt;[0]}}, $name-&gt;[1];
}
for my $pl_age (@player_ages) {

            </div> <!-- card-header -->
     <div class="card-body">       <div class="card-text"><p>I got a bit distracted this week. I was supposed to be writing a book, but as I was feeling a little unwell, I decided to do a little light recreational programming instead.</p>

<p>I'm an Amazon associate, which means if I share the right links I can drive people to the Amazon web site and get a cut of the money when they buy something. I started to muse about the idea of automatically generating pages that contain lots of the right links (books I recommend, films I enjoy, things like that). Ideally, I'd like to start with a list of ASINs (Amazon's unique product identifiers) and a TT template and end with an HTML page. I've done something like this before on the <a href="https://lineofsuccession.co.uk/shop">Line of Succession shop page</a>.</p>

<p>But when I looked at the code that generates that page I realised that all the information about the products was hard-coded in a data file. I was copying the information from Amazon myself. I can't remember why I didn't grab the information from Amazon automatically.</p>

<p>Luckily, I've done this before. Ten years ago, I wrote <a href="https://perlhacks.com/articles/modern-perl-programming/">a series of articles</a> for <em>Linux Format</em> about Modern Perl. And the application I wrote over those articles was a reading tracker. And you added books to the system by giving it an ASIN which the program then used to get the title, author and cover image from Amazon. It did that using <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Net::Amazon">Net::Amazon</a>. So I checked out the sample code, fired up the application and tried it out.</p>

<p>Only to find that it didn't work. The Amazon code was broken. Further investigation revealed that the API behind Net::Amazon had been turned off earlier this years and all requests to it returned the HTTP status "410 Gone". I found <a href="https://github.com/boumenot/p5-Net-Amazon/issues/9">a conversation about this</a> on the GitHub repo for the module, in which it's obvious that the author has little interest in updating the module to support the replacement API - which is unsurprising as it would mean a complete rewrite of the code.</p>

<p>I went off looking for alternatives. And found <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/XML::Amazon">XML::Amazon</a>. And, even better, there was a release of this module that happened after the API was turned off. But my happiness was short-lived when I discovered that it had exactly the same problem. I wondered how it had a new release if (presumably) all of the tests failed. It turns out that there's an environment variable that needs to be set in order for the live API tests to run. None of the CPAN testers will set that and I guess the author forgot to do that when releasing the new version.</p>

<p>(There's a potential blog post here about how the shrinking Perl community will see an increase of this kind of bit-rot on CPAN in the coming years - but this isn't that post.)</p>

<p>The replacement API for the one these older modules used is called the <a href="https://webservices.amazon.com/paapi5/documentation/">Product Advertising API</a> and it's completely different to the older version. I guess Amazon have learned a lot about API design in the last few years - given that they seem to release dozens of new ones each month :-)</p>

<p>But I was enthused enough to start work on a replacement. It's called Amazon::API::ProductAdvertising. It's not yet ready for CPAN, but there's a <a href="https://github.com/davorg/amazon-api-productadvertising">GitHub repo</a>. I was slightly scared by the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html">signing mechanism</a> that Amazon uses on API requests, but it turns out that <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Net::Amazon::Signature::V4">Net::Amazon::Signature::V4</a> exists and makes that really easy.</p>

<p>So it basically works. I just need to work a bit on the parameter passing (there are a <strong>lot</strong> of possible parameters), add the documentation and package it up for CPAN. I'm hoping to get that done over the weekend. This blog post is mostly here to encourage me to do that!</p>

            </div> <!-- card-header -->
     <div class="card-body">       <div class="card-text">
        <p>Perl has various ways to transfer control out of the normal flow: <code>die()</code>, <code>goto()</code>, <code>return()</code>, <code>next</code>, <code>last</code>, and <code>redo</code> are among the sorts of things I mean. Not all of these are suitable for all circumstances, and Perl issues an <a href="https://perldoc.perl.org/perldiag#Exiting-eval-via-%25s"><code>exiting</code></a> warning for unsuitable cases.</p>

<p>Sometimes, though, you just need to do something unsuitable. When I write an interactive script, it generally dispatches to a subroutine named after the function, something like so:</p>

<pre>
while ( defined( my $line = $term-&gt;readline( 'prompt&gt; ' ) ) ) {
    my ( $cmd, @arg ) = shellwords( $line );
    if ( my $code = __PACKAGE__-&gt;can( "cmd_$cmd" ) ) {
        $code-&gt;( @arg );
    } else {
        warn "Unknown command $cmd\n";
    }
}
</pre>

<p>I find this very handy; if I want to add a command, all I have to do is write a subroutine. But when I write <code>sub cmd_exit{ ... }</code>, it is not clear what goes inside the subroutine. The "proper" implementation is probably to have <code>cmd_exit()</code>, and <strong>only</strong> that subroutine, return a code that means it's time to exit the loop, and then test the return code and act appropriately. Suddenly the code got a little more complicated.</p>

<p>When refactoring a chained <code>if ( ... ) { ... } elsif ( ... ) ... </code>implementation into subroutines, I stumbled across the fact that you can, in fact, exit a subroutine with <code>last</code>. Perl warns about it, because it is not at all the usual way to do things. But it will work, and the implementation of the <code>exit</code> command becomes</p>

<pre>
sub cmd_exit {
    no warnings qw{ exiting };
    last;
}
</pre>

<p>The cautious programmer may wish to label the main loop and specify that label in the <code>last</code> statement.</p>

<p>Notes relevant to the code samples, but irrelevant to the warning being discussed:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The script samples assume <code>$term</code> is a <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Term::ReadLine"><code>Term::ReadLine</code></a> object, and that <code>shellwords()</code> comes from <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Text::ParseWords"><code>Text::ParseWords</code></a>.</li>
    <li>A more useful example of the above dispatch loop will guard against empty lines (<code>$cmd</code> is <code>undef</code>) and comments, however defined.</li>
    <li>The dispatch loop might also want to execute <code>$code-&gt;( @arg )</code> inside an <code>eval { ... }</code>.</li>
    <li>The problem with <code>sub cmd_exit { exit }</code> is that any cleanup after the dispatch loop does not get done. Time for "My Favorite Scheduled Blocks?"</li>
</ul>

     <p>Work continues at pace on the <a href="https://github.com/Perl/perl5/wiki/Google-Season-of-Docs-2021-project-proposals">comprehensive audit of Perl's core documentation collection</a>, which is funded through Google’s Season of Docs. The project was <a href="https://news.perlfoundation.org/post/perl-gsod-2021">announced</a> and began in May. As planned, it is expected to complete before the end of November.</p>

<p>Technical writer and communications specialist, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/khawarlatifkhan/">Khawar Latif Khan</a> is working in stages and has completed a full content audit alongside members of the community who have helped to test and review the documents, followed by a gap analysis, reviewing what is missing and where documents should be held.</p>

<p>Khawar began work on the project in mid-May. He says: “I was intrigued by the project. I spent some time getting familiar with perl and saw a lot of good content that needed organisation. Jason McIntosh, Dan Book and I sat together and looked at the problems users were facing and this helped me understand the limitations of perl.doc. There are more than 240 documents on perl.doc. The major aim is to create a roadmap for the future. Divide what is required into projects and sub projects, assigning tasks so we have a user-friendly picture of the documentation of perl.”</p>

<p>Jason McIntosh, Project Manager for Google Season of Docs, says: “I think the project will work really well and I see it leading to a lot of projects for the docs team which will have its work cut out for it in the best way.”</p>

<p>Not only that, it is hoped that the project will be beneficial for newcomers to perl. There may be some new users who would look at the data as it is now and be put off trying out more in perl. This project will hopefully encourage them to stick with it and see just how great perl is.</p>

<p>Jason says: “A large part of this project is about reorganising the data set, making it easier for everyone to look for documents and information, in particular this will be a great benefit for newcomers who might find the existing data set quite daunting.”</p>

<p>Khawar experienced this himself saying: “Initially, I was confused where to begin but now I have started it is interesting. I love the project. I enjoy the feedback I am getting, especially from Jason. He has been really helpful and supportive throughout the process.” </p>

<p>Jason says: “Khawar is a delight to work with. At the end of this project, he will be one of the most familiar people in the world with perl documentation. It has been of real value to go outside of the perl community, to get someone who has an objective viewpoint. We’re fortunate he was available.”</p>

     <div class="card-body">       <div class="card-text"><p>Hi there</p>
<p>I like working on legacy code whether it is Perl, Python or some other language, because it is code that is already very valuable to the organization that uses it. It is great to help the maintainers understand the code better and to give them confidence in making changes to the code.</p>
<p>There are a number of language specific tools that can help you while dealing with legacy code. For example Perl Critic which is mentioned in at least two posts this edition. There are more generic things, like setting up a good CI system which is mentioned by Gugod.</p>
<p>The ideal situation is when both management and the engineers really want the change. They still probably need some external help from someone who has experience in similar situations and who has already seen systems where the engineers have no fear in making changes. It is a totally different world than what many people experience in organizations.</p>
<p>Enjoy your fearless week!</p>       </div><!-- card-text -->     </div>

<p>If you remember, I mentioned the Outreachy program in the editorial of the weekly newsletter edition <a href="https://perlweekly.com/archive/522.html">#522</a>. It has finally come to an end as Rosheen Naeem successfully completed the internship as reported by the TPF in a <a href="https://news.perlfoundation.org/post/outreachy2021-complete">blog post</a>. Congratulations Rosheen.</p>
<p>The Perl Foundation is looking for mentors and project ideas for the next Outreachy rounds. If you have Perl or Raku project ideas, please get in touch with TPF.</p>
<p>Many years ago, I was approached for help by the Open Food Facts team as they found out about my distribution, <a href="https://metacpan.org/dist/Food-ECodes">Food::ECodes</a>. Unfortunately it didn't work out as I was too busy with my other pet projects. I hope one day I can contribute to <a href="https://github.com/openfoodfacts/openfoodfacts-server">Open Food Facts</a>. I remember I had trouble setting up a local development environment for my contributions. I haven't had a chance to see if there has been any improvements in this area to help newcomers to contribute.</p>
<p>I request Perl fans to come forward and help the cool fun project Open Food Facts.</p>

<p><em>The examples used here are from The Weekly Challenge problem statement and demonstrate 
the working solution.</em></p>

<h2>Part 1</h2>

<p><em>You are given an array of positive integers, such that all the numbers appear even number 
of times except one number. Write a script to find that integer.</em></p>

<h3>Solution</h3>

<pre><code class="perl">
use strict;
use warnings;
sub find_odd_occurring{
    my %counts;
    for my $x (@_){
        $counts{$x}++;
    }
    for my $x (keys %counts){
        return $x if $counts{$x} % 2 != 0;
    }
}

MAIN:{
    print find_odd_occurring(2, 5, 4, 4, 5, 5, 2) . "\n";
    print find_odd_occurring(1, 2, 3, 4, 3, 2, 1, 4, 4) . "\n";
}
</code></pre>

<h3>Sample Run</h3>

<pre><code class="shell">
$ perl perl/ch-1.pl
5
4
</code></pre>

<h3>Notes</h3>

<p>I spent some time thinking if this could be done without two passes over the numbers. I 
do not think that is possible, since we have no limits on the off or even occurrences.
For example, we could short circuit the checking if we knew that there might on be, say,
three occurrences of the odd number. But here we have no such limitations and so we must 
tally all numbers in the list and then check to see which has an odd number of 
occurrences.</p>

<h3>Notes</h3>

<p>All my code, for the time being at least, has converged on a pretty standard approach 
using Class::Struct. I have done this enough recently where I've convinced myself this is
the best for several reasons</p>

<ul>
<li>This allows for object oriented construction of the data structure with almost the
minimum overhead
</li>
<li>While providing for some OO structure, other than generating default accessor methods
there is not too much done behind the scenes. Organizing the code this way does not feel
like "cheating" in that there is any reliance on the OO framework, since it is so minimal.
</li>
<li>Many classic texts on data structures use C and that languages <code>struct</code> ability. Some
superficial resemblance to that code is helpful in translating examples from the 
literature to Perl. 
</li>
</ul>

<p>The first issue to deal with this part of the challenge is to construct a Binary Tree, but
not do any sort of balancing when performing insertions into the tree. To do this I made
a simple insert function which takes a source and target node and a third parameter which 
dictates whether the target is to be the left or right child of the source. In this way
we can easily construct a broken binary tree.</p>

<p>Actually verifying whether the tree is a proper BST follows fairly directly from the 
definition of a Binary Tree. For each node, including the root, we check to see if the 
largest value to the left is smaller as well as the minimum value to the right being 
larger.</p>

     <div class="card-body">       <div class="card-text"><p>Hi there!</p>
<p>A long long time ago, when I was in high school, I participated in the annual competition of <a href="https://www.komal.hu/">KöMaL, the Mathematical and Physical Journal for High Schools</a>. (Look for the little UK flag for the English version). Back then we sent in the solution by snail-mail and we only had to write our name to be identified. However people with very common names were asked to include a 3-digit number between their names. There was no verification that two people with the exact same name did not pick the same number, but the chances were slim. Because my name is way too common in Hungary I picked the number 529 because it is 23^2. Funnily, if you squint it also resembles the initials of my name: SzG</p>
<p>Anyway, if you or your kids like math, informatics, or physics, I'd recommend it!</p>

<h3>Notes</h3>

<p>In the past, for this sort of problem, I would separate out the Tree package into 
its own file . Here I decided to keep everything in one file, but still divide everything
into the proper packages.</p>

<p>While creating a Tree package from scratch was fun, getting that data structure correct
is just half the battle. Still need to solve the problem! To that end we need to start at
the root of the tree and then descend and count how many levels down the node is found, if
it exists. If not return -1.</p>

<p>One issue is that to store the edges I use a hash with Nodes as keys. To use a Node 
instance as a key we need to use Tie::RefHash. There is a slight trick here though, to 
properly retrieve the value we need to access the keys using <code>keys</code>. Here I store the keys 
in an array and <code>grep</code> for a match. A slightly awkward requirement, but the work around is
easy enough.</p>

<h3>Notes</h3>

<p>My opinion on LinkedList problems may not be shared by the majority of Team PWC. I love
Linked List problems! </p>

<p>Similar to the first part of Challenge 129 Class::Struct is used to create the data 
structure central tot he problem. This LinkedList implementation just has an <code>insert()</code>
and two <code>stringify</code> functions, along with the required <code>add()</code>.</p>

<p>The problem asks to sum two linked lists of single digit numbers. The <code>add()</code> function
works in the same way that one would manually add the numbers. The sum of the two lists
is represented as a new Linked List, but to represent it properly it is output in reverse.
That should be fine for the purposes of this challenge. Other options are:</p>

<ul>
<li>a function for inserting at the end of the list, insert at each addition step
</li>
<li>holding the sum in an array and when <code>add()</code> is finished with all list elements use the
existing <code>insert()</code> and create a LinkedList instance to return by <code>shift</code>ing off the 
array.
</li>
</ul>
