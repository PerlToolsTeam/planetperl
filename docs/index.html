<p>And that's it. Three simple commands to remember and git <em>gets out of your way</em>.</p>

<h1>
  <a href="#the-overview" class="anchor">
  </a>
  The Overview
</h1>

<p>The <code>git</code> command is extremely complicated.  Invariably in a team environment, someone gets something "wrong" with git and the local git guru comes by and does mysterious things with <code>git fsck</code>, <code>git reflog</code>, and other commands that developers have never heard of. And while it's useful to have a git guru on hand, we find it's even easier to have a single, standard way of using git so that all developers are doing things the same way. Even developers new to git find our workflow very easy.</p>

<p>It's designed largely to avoid git histories which make the Gordian Knot look like a bowtie.</p>

<p><a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--jvvS5ij9--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ltl5wof7evawfa7dlzea.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--jvvS5ij9--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ltl5wof7evawfa7dlzea.png" alt='A convoluted map of the London Underground with the caption "A typical git history"'></a></p>

<p>For us, the complicated history was the showstopper. We want a clean, linear history and an "easy-to-use" workflow. It's based on the following logic:</p>

<ol>
<li>The <code>master</code> branch is the source of truth</li>
<li>All new development happens in a new branch off of <code>master</code>
</li>
<li>When you're done, merge your code back into <code>master</code> and delete your branches</li>
</ol>

<p>In other words, it's very clean, very simple, and focuses on the core development needs. There's nothing surprising about this workflow. How do releases work? That depends on your project and its needs. How do hotfixes work? That depends on your project and its needs. How do code reviews work?  That depends on your project and its needs.  This workflow is designed to be the <em>core</em> of what you do day in and day out. The bits you need to customize are up to you. I'm not dogmatic.</p>

<h2>
  <a href="#gitflow" class="anchor">

</h2>

<p>As an aside, one popular workflow is <a href="https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/">git-flow</a>.  Yet <a href="https://www.endoflineblog.com/gitflow-considered-harmful">git-flow has its detractors</a> and it's easy to find <a href="https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-d&amp;q=what%27s+wrong+with+git-flow">many more</a>.  I found the convoluted history and strict requirements that things be "just so" to not be a good fit for our workflow. It might be the perfect fit for yours.</p>

<h1>
  <a href="#our-git-workflow" class="anchor">
  </a>
  Our git Workflow
</h1>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/Ovid/git-workflow">git workflow tools</a> are open source and they contain a simplified subset of the git tools used by <a href="https://allaroundtheworld.fr/">All Around the World</a> for our software development. It makes it dead easy for teams using git (and in our case, github) to work together.</p>

<p>There are only three new commands to remember:</p>

<ol>
<li>
<code>git hub $issue</code> Create new branch based on a github ticket</li>
<li>
<code>git refresh</code> Rebase your work on top of current master</li>
<li>
<code>git merge-with-master</code> Merge your branch back into master</li>
</ol>

<p>Note: you don't even need the <code>bin/git-hub</code> command. It assumes you're using github, but other commands work fine without it. Further, the <code>bin/git-hub</code> code uses Perl 5.20 and needs some modules installed. However, <code>git refresh</code> and <code>git merge-with-master</code> are just bash scripts, so they'll work fine out of the box if you can use bash.</p>

<h1>
  <a href="#assumptions" class="anchor">
  </a>
  Assumptions
</h1>

<p>The <code>master</code> branch is never worked on directly. Instead, new branches are created (usually for an individual github ticket), we hack, we regularly pull new changes into that branch, and after a pull request is created and the approved, we merge the code back into <code>master</code>.</p>

<p>The examples below assume the files in the <code>bin/</code> directory are in your path.  If they are not in your path, you have to type the commands explicitly:</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>bin/git-hub 5738
bin/git-refresh
bin/git-merge-with-master
</code></pre>
<div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel">
<div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action">
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


</div>
</div>
</div>
<h2>
  <a href="#checking-out-a-branch" class="anchor">
  </a>
  Checking Out a Branch
</h2>

<p>I assume that branches are <em>usually</em> per ticket. You can manually create a branch, but I tend not to. Instead, if you are going to work on github issue 5738, with the title "Reduce reputation for failed crimes", you run the following command:</p>
<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>git hub 5738
</code></pre>
<div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel">
<div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action">
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>And you're in a shiny new branch named <code>reduce-reputation-for-failed-crimes-5738</code>.</p>

<p>If that branch already exists, it's checked out.</p>

<p>If you're not using github, it's trivial to do this by hand:</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>git checkout -b name-of-your-branch
</code></pre>
<div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel">
<div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action">
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>I just like the convenience of always having standard naming conventions. And if someone wants to contribute a <code>bin/git-lab</code> script to the project, I'll happily accept it (though a more general <code>bin/git-start-ticket</code> would probably be better).</p>

<h3>
  <a href="#caveats" class="anchor">
  </a>
  Caveats
</h3>

<ol>
<li>The new branch that is created is based on the branch you're on, so you probably want to run this from <code>master</code>
</li>
<li>Branch detection is based on a heuristic, using the ticket number. If you have more than one branch with that ticket number, you will get a warning and the code will exit.</li>
<li>You'll need a config file for this. See <code>perldoc bin/git-hub</code> for this.</li>
<li>Assumes Perl 5 version 20</li>
</ol>

<p>You will also need to install the following modules from the <a href="https://metacpan.org/">CPAN</a> if you've not already done so.</p>

<ul>
<li><code>autodie</code></li>
<li><code>Config::General</code></li>
<li><code>JSON</code></li>
<li><code>Text::Unidecode</code></li>
<li><code>Pithub</code></li>
</ul>

<p>If you're not familiar with installing CPAN modules, check out <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/App::cpanminus">cpanminus</a>, or you can use the <code>cpan</code> command line tool that is standard with Perl.</p>

<h2>
  <a href="#refreshing-your-branch" class="anchor">
  </a>
  Refreshing Your Branch
</h2>

<p>While working on your branch, you want to regularly pull in the latest <code>master</code> to keep your code up-to-date. Working on a change for a week with a fast-moving codebase can cause serious headaches when it's time to merge. Thus, you should regularly run the following in your branch (I try to run it at least once per day):</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>git refresh
</code></pre>
<div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel">
<div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action">
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Regardless of the branch you are on, this code:</p>

<ul>
<li>Stashes changes (if any)</li>
<li>Checks out master</li>
<li>Does a fast-forward merge</li>
<li>Checks out your branch (if branch is not master)</li>
<li>Rebases onto <code>master</code> (if branch is not master)</li>
<li>Pops changes from stash, if any</li>
</ul>

<p>In other words, it cleanly rebases your code on top of master, even if you have uncommitted changes.</p>

<p>Note: for everyone who keeps asking "why not <code>git pull --rebase --autostash</code>?"</p>

<p>The simple reason is backwards-compatibility. Sometimes developers have older versions of git installed and while that's usually perfectly compatible with newer versions, we don't force them to upgrade. Also, internally <code>git-refresh</code> does things like <code>git fetch -p</code> to remove references to remote branches which no longer exist. This regular "house cleaning" helps to keep git more performant. See the <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-fetch#_pruning">Pruning</a> documentation for <code>git-fetch</code> for more information.</p>

<p>Note: if this command aborts (such as during a merge conflict), the stashed changes will remain stashed. Run <code>git stash</code> to see those changes and <code>git stash pop</code> to return them to your codebase when you've finished resolving the merge conflicts.</p>

<h2>
  <a href="#merging-into-master" class="anchor">
  </a>
  Merging into master
</h2>

<p>So you've finished your work and are ready to merge your branch back into master. Here's one way to do that very cleanly and safely:</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>git checkout master
git fetch --prune
git merge --ff-only origin/master
git rebase master my-awesome-feature-1234
git push --force-with-lease origin my-awesome-feature-1234
git checkout master
git merge --no-ff my-awesome-feature-1234
git push origin master
</code></pre>
<div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel">
<div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action">
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>You'll remember that, right? And you'll never mess it up?</p>

<p>For us, we simply run:</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>git merge-with-master
</code></pre>
<div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel">
<div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action">
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>And that will cleanly update <code>master</code> and rebase your branch on top of it, and push that change to your origin.</p>

<p>With that, you get a clean git history like this:</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>| * 44eba1b094 - ...
| * 217350810f - ...

<div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel">
<div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action">
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>And when you're done, it will also print out the instructions on how you can delete your local and remote copies of the branch, to help you be nice and not leave branches cluttering up the repository.</p>

<h1>
  <a href="#merge-conflicts" class="anchor">
  </a>
  Merge Conflicts
</h1>

<p>With all of this rebasing, you're sometimes going to hit the dreaded ...</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>Auto-merging lib/Veure/Moose.pm
CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in lib/Veure/Moose.pm
Failed to merge in the changes.

<div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel">
<div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action">
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>And then you're very unhappy. Worse, if you do this after a week of isolated hacking, you might get a <em>huge</em> amount of merge conflicts to work through.  However, by running <code>git refresh</code> at least once a day, if not more often, those conflicts are minimized. And when you do get them? I have the following in my <code>.bash_aliases</code> file:</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>alias damnit='${EDITOR:-vim} $(git grep -l "&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; HEAD")'
</code></pre>
<div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel">
<div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action">
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Then, when I get a conflict, I just type <code>damnit</code> and am automatically editing the files which caused the conflict. It saves me a huge amount of time.</p>

<p>If you have <a href="https://beyondgrep.com/">ack</a> installed, you might find this better:</p>


<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>alias damnit="${EDITOR:-vim} $(ack -l --nopager '^(?:&lt;|&gt;|=){7}(?:\s|$)')"<br>

<p>To improve output, we can tweak a bit the <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Data::Dumper#Configuration-Variables-or-Methods">behavior of Data::Dumper</a> but if you want my opinion there is a better option...</p>

<p>First, install <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Data::Printer">Data::Printer</a> with a CPAN client <code>cpanm Data::Printer</code>.</p>

        <p><em>Too fanboy/girl-ish, perhaps?</em></p>

<p>Yes, I'm well on-trend, by a couple of months.
As you see, lockdown has made a hot mess of my blogging schedule.
I count myself very fortunate that is the worst effect it's had on me, alongside the gaining of some mass.</p>

<p><strong>WfH WARNING!</strong> Watch out for those caramel waffles!
A <em>single</em> Stroopwaffle has enough calories to feed a hungry village for a day and are not a sustainable treatment for anxiety.
Two <strong>kWh</strong> per packet, not a word of a lie.</p>

        <h2>on RT .. or “I agree with everybody”</h2>

<p>Are we flogging a dead horse here?</p>

<p>I understand the pull of fulfilling one’s civic duty by stepping up to take responsibility for a community resource.  You get that warm glow inside that masks the early symptoms of burnout.
There’s a palpable pressure to do everything in Perl to demonstrate the capabilities of the language and that we eat our own dogfood.  The problem is that we don’t have the budget (aka tuits) for the shiny toys that we want to showcase our favourite language.
The argument boils down to</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Opportunity cost of maintaining things that other people are doing well</p>
</blockquote>

<p>vs</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Pride of showing off our talents</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If what we do doesn't look good, it's not doing the job of showing off and lack of utility becomes a liability.  We have limited resources now and have to choose what we can support.</p>

<p>On the other hand, I do use <a href="http://blogs.perl.org">bpo</a> a lot (broken as it is[0]) as a place for search engines to find some obscure solution
that I don't think many people are interested in, just the one person with the same problem. And because Dave <a href="http://blogs.perl.org/users/enkidu/2013/01/moose-mashing.html">asked us to</a>.   It's a useful community resource - perl challenge repo, source for perl weekly, etc.
Also, I like the pseudo-anonymity it provides so I can blog about work without embarrassing anyone and I probably should take the opportunity to talk about semi-taboo issues such as mental health.  I poke around stackoverflow and perlmonks a bit.  Someday, I’ll get around to creating a dev.to account, but not reddit.  I don’t need that monkey on my back.</p>

<h2>Less Management, more Leadership</h2>

<p>So why do people always leap in at the last minute to keep the patient on life support?  In this case, I think that it’s a clear, well-defined task that is a simple matter of maintenance, easy to understand.  There is no glory and no glory is sought.  It is reactive and responsive, not proactive and driven.  Catharsis after a hard day’s work, perhaps?</p>

<p>More challenging is the lofty goal to <strong>Make Perl Great Again</strong>.  The only clear idea there is that, given a box of Sharpies, you can get your hands on a lot of branded merch going dirt cheap.  The fact that great things are <em>not</em> made great by a single person is made less clear by our notable exceptions.  You cannot be a BDFL if no one cares to play with your toys.</p>

<p>The Perl success stories have gathered sustainable communities around them and individuals have taken on leadership roles because there is no progress without them.  And that means willingly dealing with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Exit">other people</a>.  Anyone who has organized an Advent calendar knows that a little bit of, ever-so-polite, arm twisting is involved and the world benefits.</p>

<p>All of the current ideas not already in progress that really would make Perl great are so poorly described that if they were a ticket given to you at work, you’d send them straight back to for clarification.  You wouldn’t even waste time estimating them because the only way to figure out what needs to be done is to do it.</p>

<p>So, faced with the choice of doing something easy or <a href="http://www.antarctic-circle.org/advert.htm">sailing off to the other side of the world</a>, you’re going to have to generate some excitement about what you’re doing to get volunteers[1].
If you really think that RT isn’t fit for purpose, start asking people to help you out doing the stuff you think we should be doing.</p>

<p>Me? Well, 15 months ago, I was planning on making Perl the new language for Data Science by 2021, making plans, lining up some arms to twist, when all of a sudden I got distracted by sumthin er other.  <em>now where was I?  Oh, yes .. k-means!</em>
<em>… and then there’s my list of posts and there’s my list of vict^Wvolunteers</em></p>

<p>Feeling inspired to take up your own challenge?  Like Jackie Weaver facilitating the <a href="https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/uk-news/who-is-jackie-weaver-handforth-19774637">Handforth Parish Council Planning meeting</a>,
<strong>you have the authority</strong>.</p>

<h2>Perl 7</h2>

<p>My only contribution to the Perl 7 debate, other than a <em>just close your eyes and pull the trigger</em> level of encouragement (I get like this when I don't know the consequences ;) is not to enforce "<em>use strict</em>" on one-liners.  It's the <strong>one</strong> place where I can see all the code and I'm throwing it away in a few minutes.  Typing "my" in front of every variable that I want to stuff temp values in is going to slow me down.  I don't need the level of helicopter parenting that puts a helmet on a kid for just walking down the street.  Making helmets required for riding motorbikes I can get behind.</p>

<p>Oh, and get Corinna "inna da core" post-haste.  A succinct, Moose-like class declaration syntax for OO was the <em>only</em> thing that impressed a python newbie I was trying to show off to.  Make the easy things easy and develop modules for the hard things.</p>

<p>Did I speak too soon?  The previous para was written in the time honoured tradition of commenting before reading <a href="https://github.com/Ovid/Cor/wiki/Corinna-Overview">the Overview of Corinna</a>.  Now that I have, I’m conflicted.  It’s way too terse for my liking.  I’d use it in my modules just to have an OO that I can ship without some people getting worked up over installing non-core stuff, but sigils in the attribute declaration break up the flow of reading.  One line declarations are just dragging us back into line-noise territory.  A minified class definition won’t convince anyone to use Perl.</p>

<p><em>Did I just become the person I was hating on at the top of this post?  I <strong>am</strong> conflicted.</em>
...well, it’s <a href="https://github.com/Ovid/Cor/wiki">all up for feedback</a>, so maybe I should go and leave some coherent thoughts.</p>

<p>[0] Why yes, bpo did eat one set of really good edits because I was foolish enough to think it really was saving when it said it was auto-saving.  I knew this behaviour. Shame on me.</p>

<p>[1] Apologies.  It’s late and I’ve been rambling.  Fininsishing it before it gets any worse.</p>

<p>If you haven’t already, <strong>you’ll need to <a href="https://www.perl.org/get.html">install Perl</a></strong>. Using Linux or macOS? You’ve already got Perl installed on your system. On Windows? I recommend you <a href="https://strawberryperl.com/">install Strawberry Perl</a> as it lets you develop Perl applications using the same tools that our Unix-based brethren use.</p>

<p>(Advanced users may want to investigate using <a href="https://perlbrew.pl/">perlbrew</a>, <a href="https://github.com/tokuhirom/plenv">plenv</a>, or <a href="https://github.com/dnmfarrell/berrybrew">berrybrew</a> for managing multiple versions of Perl and installing more recent versions than are included on your system.)</p>

<p>Once you have Perl installed, it’s a simple matter of <strong>using either the <code>cpan</code> or <code>cpanm</code> tools to install Mojolicious and <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Mojolicious::Plugin::OpenAPI">Mojolicious::Plugin::OpenAPI</a></strong>. The latter will install some dependencies as well. Here’s a transcript of installing <code>cpanm</code> and the two modules:<br>

<p>This command <strong>builds the scaffolding</strong> for our new project. We won’t be using all of it, but it does provide some useful starting points.</p>

<p>(Why did we put <code>Local::</code> in the beginning of the name? Because <a href="https://pause.cpan.org/pause/query?ACTION=pause_namingmodules#Local">nothing you place there will conflict with other modules you install from CPAN</a>.)</p>

<p>Next, <strong>put the OpenAPI document we developed in <a href="https://phoenixtrap.com/2021/02/27/perl-microservice-part-1/">part 1</a> somewhere in the project</strong>. We’ll choose <code>openapi/dictionary_openapi.yml</code>. Create a folder called <code>openapi</code> in the project, and then open your text editor and paste the following document into a file called <code>dictionary_openapi.yml</code>.</p>

<p>…and then going to that URL on the last line.</p>

<p>After you’ve verified that it works, hold down the <em>Control</em> key and type the letter <em>C</em> in your terminal to stop the script. <strong>Edit the <code>lib/Local/Dictionary/Microservice.pm</code> file in your text editor</strong>. Replace it with this:</p>


<div class="ltag_gist-liquid-tag">

<p>Now when you run the script as a daemon, the URL it reports responds with the JSON version of our OpenAPI document. Progress!</p>

<p><strong>Note the <code>$self-&gt;plugin()</code> call towards the end of our class above.</strong> That’s the secret sauce that loads our OpenAPI document and tells Mojolicious to create responses from it.</p>

<p>Note in the second line of output that <strong>Mojolicious tried to route to a controller class</strong> at <code>Local::Dictionary::Microservice::Controller::Word</code> with an action of <code>save</code>.

<p>Now we’ll <strong>write the controller class</strong> at <code>lib/Local/Dictionary/Microservice/Controller/Word.pm</code>:</p>

<p>The <code>save</code> method above retrieves the <code>word</code> and <code>definition</code> parameters from the URL path and POST data, respectively, and then <strong>saves them into a hash that is <a href="https://perldoc.pl/DB_File"><code>tie</code>d to a Berkeley DB</a> file</strong> stored in <code>definitions.db</code>.

<p>Woohoo, our method works! <strong>Let’s add some tests to the same <code>t/word.t</code> script</strong> , underneath the first one:</p>


<div class="ltag_gist-liquid-tag">
  
</div>



<p>Here we’re testing that we get back the definition we saved, that we can delete the definition, and that when we try to retrieve it again we get a <code>404 Not Found</code> error.</p>

<p>The test script will fail again, but <strong>we can fix that</strong> by adding the <code>define</code> and <code>remove</code> methods to our controller class in <code>lib/Local/Dictionary/Microservice/Controller/Word.pm</code>:</p>

<p><strong>Congratulations! You now have a simple microservice</strong> for storing and retrieving definitions of words. You can now write a web front-end in HTML and JavaScript, or perhaps another microservice that consumes this one.</p>

<p>(As an exercise, write the <code>/health</code> route defined in our OpenAPI document. It calls a <code>heartbeat</code> method in a controller class named <code>Monitoring</code>.)</p>

<h2>
  <a href="#what-next" class="anchor">
  </a>
  What next?
</h2>

<ul>
<li>You may not want to store your definitions in a DB file in your project; consider <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/distribution/Mojolicious/lib/Mojolicious/Guides/Cookbook.pod#Adding-a-configuration-file">making it a configurable option</a>. Or use one of the <a href="https://metacpan.org/">many modules on CPAN</a> to <strong>choose a completely different backend</strong>.</li>
<li>Add methods to list some or all definitions, using <a href="https://restfulapi.net/hateoas/">hypertext as the engine of application state (HATEOAS)</a> to render links where appropriate.</li>
<li>Support multiple definitions of the same word, or expand the API to respond with synonyms and antonyms. (Just make sure to <strong>increment the version</strong> in the OpenAPI document and add some way for clients to specify the version to indicate you’re making a breaking change!)</li>
</ul>

     <p>Jonathan Worthington writes about his RakuAST progress during February 2021:</p>

<hr />

<p>During February much of my Raku working time was spent on my ongoing dispatcher work. However, I also got back into working on RakuAST. I implemented AST nodes, wrote AST tests, and updated the new RakuAST-based compiler frontend to cover:</p>

<ul>
<li>The <code>given</code>, <code>with</code>, <code>without</code>, and <code>when</code> statement modifiers (and I believe most of them produce cheaper code than in the current compiler)</li>
<li>Anonymous variables (<code>my $ = 42</code> and similar, but also the use of a lone <code>$</code>, which declares an anonymous state variable)</li>
<li>The <code>is</code> trait modifier (for the cases of traits that are implemented so far); of note, that means inheritance (<code>class Spork is Spoon is Fork {}</code>) now compiles</li>
<li>Basic cases of the reduce meta-op (for example, <code>[+] 1,2,3</code>)</li>
</ul>

<p>I also implemented calculating types by sigil for parameters when compiling those via RakuAST.</p>

<p>From this work, 11 further spectest files now pass in full using the RakuAST-based compiler frontend, bringing the total to 225 passing spectest files.</p>

<p>It is based on the Zopfli gzip compression library from Google Research.</p>

<p>Both Zopfli and libdeflate seem to excel at compressing JSON files compared to the ordinary zlib compression, sometimes with an improvement of up to 30%. Zopfli usually wins by a small margin over libdeflate.

     <div class="card-body">       <div class="card-text"><p>Hi there!</p>
<p>Recently I wrote quite a few posts about dealing with legacy Perl code in corporations. One of the key things is the need to write automated tests and to set up a CI system. The Perl community was really good at writing tests for the CPAN modules and making it easy to write test. The Perl community (or members of it) even created the <a href="http://www.cpantesters.org/">CPAN Testers</a> a sort of slow CI system that was one of the best such systems in the early 2000s.</p>
<p>However when I look at the <a href="https://perlweekly.com/metacpan.html">stats</a> I've been  collecting it seems that only 50% of recently uploaded CPAN modules have any form of CI system configured. (Actually maybe I should look at the cup half full and celebrate that 50% already have CI? I don't have numbers about other programming language communities.) I keep hoping that more people will embrace the idea. I even recorded a video explaining the new CI system I set up for Test::Class.</p>
<p>rt.cpan.org moved to its new host without any noticeable downtime.</p>
<p>MetaCPAN keyboard shortcuts: Did you know that pressing '?' while on MetaCPAN will show you the keyboard shortcuts? I did not. I ran a poll in the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/perlprogrammers/permalink/4036194559746635/">Perl programmers</a> group on Facebook: 102 did not know, and only 2 new. One of them being Olaf Alders, who runs MetaCPAN. I also asked on the <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/perl-maven_perl-activity-6771106440284262400-IT2N/">Perl Maven</a> LinkedIn page. You can still vote there.</p>
<p>Enjoy your week!</p>       </div><!-- card-text -->     </div>

<p>For a week we lost control of the Perl.com domain. Now that the incident
has died down, we can explain some of what happened and how we handled it.
This incident only affected the domain ownership of Perl.com and there was
no other compromise of community resources. This website was still there,
but DNS was handing out different IP numbers.</p>

<p>First, this wasn&rsquo;t an issue of not renewing the domain. That would have
been a better situation for us because there&rsquo;s a grace period.</p>

<p>Second, to be very clear, I&rsquo;m just an editor for the website that uses
the Perl.com domain. This means that I&rsquo;m not actually the &ldquo;injured party&rdquo;
in legal terms. Tom Christiansen is the domain registrant, and should
legal matters progress, there&rsquo;s no reason for me, nor anyone else, to
know all of the details. However, I&rsquo;ve talked to many of the people involved
in the process.</p>

<h2 id="the-incident-response">The incident response</h2>

<p>I think we did a pretty good job with the decentralized, volunteer
incident response, so I&rsquo;d like to share part of what we did as I tell
you the story. You may have had the pleasure (or pain) of a formal
response, and there are various things you can do to forego extra
headaches and frustration.</p>

<p>Early on the morning of January 27, the Perl NOC noticed through normal
monitoring that something was wrong with the domain. Along with that,
people started to report that the website had gone missing. As DNS updated
across the globe, more and more people reported problems. We didn&rsquo;t know
what was happening or why.</p>

<p>Behind the scenes I started to collect incident information, and I put
out <a href="https://twitter.com/briandfoy_perl/status/1354535622069919748">a tweet asking for help</a>.
At this point we didn&rsquo;t know what was going on; we just knew the
effect. It&rsquo;s important during the early stages of a response to verify
what&rsquo;s known and what&rsquo;s rumor, and to separate who knows something and
who&rsquo;s passing around rumors. As with most situations, it&rsquo;s that rumor
group that dominates the conversation and they often have a more
interesting story to tell because they can speculate and fabricate any
narrative they like. Work the problem without speculation—find out
what you actually know and what&rsquo;s just a guess.</p>

<p>I started a Google doc and invited the relevant people. We started to
fill in the details, classifying everything according with either
green, amber, or red. Green was high confidence information, such as
direct communication with a registrar, amber was likely good but
unverified, and red was just flat out wrong. All information was
tagged with a time and source. The first rule of rumor control is
stating who you heard it from and when. Once this is in the document,
other people know if what they think they know is better or more
recent. And, sometimes the information that we thought was good turns
out to be wrong. In those cases we update the document.</p>

<p>We also listed things that needed to happen, and various people picked
up what they could address. For example, we started to check other
community resources, so Elaine Ashton looked at the registration for
cpan.org, which had an oddity in its contact info but later turned out
to be fine after she dealt with the registrar on the phone. Robert
Spier, part of the Perl NOC, was able to verify various network
aspects, timelines, and so on. Rik Signes stepped up to set up a
private mailing list on <a href="https://www.topicbox.com">TopicBox</a> (he is
the CTO, after all). The trick here is to not do work that someone
else can do for you (and often better than you can). Likewise, if
someone is already doing something, you&rsquo;re wasting your time (and
others&rsquo; time) by redoing or reinventing it. Decentralization is fine,
but someone needs to be the coordinator. In this case that turned out
to be me because I had a lot invested in the Perl.com website, and I
could easily work with Tom because we worked with each
other for a year on <a href="https://www.programmingperl.org">Programming Perl</a>.</p>

<p>My tweet and my reddit comments got the attention of both sides of the
registrar equation, so I was talking to both Network Solutions and Key
Systems very early in the process. We were very fortunate to that Perl
is a known thing and that both Tom Christiansen and I are well-known
within Perl. The first rule to success is to already be successful.
People inside various organizations involved offered us help and
guidance. Other victims were not so fortunate and help for them was
not forthcoming. And, at some point, Perl was probably running those
organizations, so there&rsquo;s some fondness for the good ol&rsquo; days.</p>

<p>Mostly, I helped both sides get in touch with Tom Christiansen and
helped him manage all the players.  In many incidents, people become
overwhelmed by everything that needs to happen and end up not doing
anything. He needed to work with the registrars, so I took what work I
could off his plate so he could focus on that bit.</p>

<p>We had learned very quickly that when you use the registered domain
for your email contact, no one can contact you when that domain no
longer handles your mail. Most of that hassle was verifying that
people were who they say they are, but in the domain business,
everyone knows who the real people are—this is what they do every
day. We made sure that we didn&rsquo;t overload them with inquiries from
several different people asking the same question. Coordinating who is
working with whom avoids the N-squared communication issues and lets
people do the work they need to do rather than answer the same questions
repeatedly.</p>

<p>Once everyone who needed to talk to each other had good contact info,
the process mostly took care of itself. We didn&rsquo;t know that everything
would work out, but as the situation developed we became more
confident that it would. Our confidence, however, isn&rsquo;t reportable
information. You don&rsquo;t announce what you think will happen or what is
promised to happen because often there are delays or hiccups.</p>

<p>We transitioned to managing public information and sharing what we
could. Our goal was to give people the confidence that they had the
right info. As a techy audience, we often like to have all the
information, but there&rsquo;s very little that anyone actually needs to
know.</p>

<p>We settled
on having all the updated info in one place, at <a href="https://log.perl.org/2021/01/perlcom-hijacked.html">The Perl NOC
blog</a>. Sometimes
we knew things several hours before we published the information
because we did the extra work to directly verify things. People didn&rsquo;t
have to track social media, etc to find out what was going on because
they could remember this one place. We still broadcast updates
all over the place, but always pointed back to the NOC blog. A single
point of reference is very helpful.</p>

<p>For those in the incident response, we developed a current situation summary
and talking points. These were basically the things that we had verified
that we could disclose without compromising the legal process.</p>

<p>We also tracked people and stories. Who&rsquo;s who at various companies,
which reporters are writing about the incident, and what discussion
threads are out there. Some people in various discussion threads were
obviously just there for the lulz, while others had good or actionable
details (which often means they are on the inside of the situation).
Again, we used the green / amber / red categories.</p>

<p>This isn&rsquo;t my first rodeo, and I stepped into the role of press
contact. Despite our diligent work to verify everything, many outside
people just made up stuff. That&rsquo;s just how it is and I expected that.
The publishing maxim &ldquo;If your mother says she loves you, get a second
source&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t apply in the age of Twitter. You don&rsquo;t even need the
first source.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s important to have one face (mouth?) to represent the diligent
work everyone was doing.  Half the &ldquo;news&rdquo; stories didn&rsquo;t do basic
research, and some of those reporters don&rsquo;t even have contact info
(really, a reporter you can&rsquo;t contact?). A few were able to correct
their stories after talking to me.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2021/01/28/perl_hijacking/">The
Register</a> had
spot on reporting from the start as did <a href="https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2021/01/29/the-mystery-of-the-missing-perl-webite/">Paul Ducklin at
Sophos</a>.</p>

<p>About a week after the nameservers changed, I had settled into the
idea that it could take several weeks to unravel the hijacking. With
multiple countries involved along with various sets of laws and rules
in effect, things might have a much slower pace than we&rsquo;d like. In the
internet age, tomorrow is basically infinitely far away. David Farrell
floated the idea of renaming the site, and we started using
<em>perldotcom.perl.org</em> as a temporary domain. Robert was able to set
that up quickly, and we even got some good work out of it as pull
requests from the community found spots where we had hard-coded
various things that we shouldn&rsquo;t have (anyone can send a pull request
for anything about the site!). The GitHub process that David had set
up was key to making all of this work; it&rsquo;s a pleasure to get even the
tiniest pull requests from the community.</p>

<p>Then, in early February I got some solid (green) back-channel information that
we&rsquo;d get the domain back in a couple of days. I was dubious but it actually
happened! Again, I think we were very fortunate here and that many people
with a soft spot in their hearts for Perl did a lot of good work for
us. All sides understood that Perl.com belonged to Tom and it was a
simple matter of work to resolve it. A relatively unknown domain
name might not fare as well in proving they own it.</p>

<p>Recovering the domain wasn&rsquo;t the end of the response though. While the
domain was compromised, various security products had blacklisted
Perl.com and some DNS servers had sinkholed it. We figured that would
naturally work itself out, so we didn&rsquo;t immediately celebrate the
return of Perl.com. We wanted it to be back for everyone. And, I think
we&rsquo;re fully back. However, if you have problems with the domain, please
<a href="https://github.com/tpf/perldotcom/issues">raise an issue</a> so we at least
know it&rsquo;s not working for part of the internet.</p>

<h2 id="what-we-think-happened">What we think happened</h2>

<p>This part veers into some speculation, and Perl.com wasn&rsquo;t the only victim.
We think that there was a social engineering attack on Network Solutions, including
phony documents and so on. There&rsquo;s no reason for Network Solutions
to reveal anything to me (again, I&rsquo;m not the injured party), but I did talk
to other domain owners involved and this is the basic scheme they reported.</p>

<p>John Berryhill provided <a href="https://twitter.com/briandfoy_perl/status/1354535622069919748">some forensic work in Twitter</a> that showed the
compromise actually happened in September. The domain was transferred
to the BizCN registrar in December, but the nameservers were not changed. The domain was
transferred again in January to another registrar, Key Systems, GmbH. This latency period
avoids immediate detection, and bouncing the domain through a couple
registrars makes the recovery much harder.</p>

<p><img src="https://perl.com/images/the_hijack_of_perldotcom/step2.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Notice the long lag time of the first transfer, though. The domain is
compromised in September but transferred in December. There&rsquo;s a reason for
that: ICANN has a <a href="https://www.icann.org/resources/pages/name-holder-faqs-2017-10-10-en">60-day rule</a>.
You can&rsquo;t transfer the domain within 60 days of updating the contact
info. We think part of the attack changed the registration at the same
time as the attackers renewed the domain for a couple more years past its original
expiration in 2029.</p>

<p>Once transferred to Key Systems in late January, the new, fraudulent registrant listed the domain (along with
others), on Afternic (a domain marketplace). If you had $190,000, you could have bought Perl.com.
This was quickly de-listed after the <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2021/01/28/perl_hijacking/">The Register made inquiries</a>.</p>

<h2 id="some-lessons">Some lessons</h2>

<p>Obviously this is an embarrassing situation, but it&rsquo;s not an uncommon
story. This domain was registered in the early 90s, Tom Christiansen
was given control of it shortly after that, and basically kept paying the
registration fees. Since it wasn&rsquo;t a nagging problem, the domain was
left as it was. Features such as two-factor authentication probably
would have saved us much of this trouble (although social engineering
attacks tend to route around safeguards).</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve already mentioned the problem with using the domain in the contacts
for the domain. When there&rsquo;s a problem, the communication channels are
also borked. Have at least one of the contacts go somewhere else.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s essential to communicate with &ldquo;one voice&rdquo; else you risk sowing confusion
with different messages, even if they&rsquo;re saying the same thing. You also want
to project confidence, and competence so that the information you do release
is treated credibly; if different channels are releasing different updates,
the risk of error increases. The Perl Foundation insisted on releasing their
own <a href="https://news.perlfoundation.org/post/perl.com-registry-attack">update</a>
instead of using our prepared statement. And even though it was brief, the link
to the Perl NOC blog was broken for several days. Don&rsquo;t take unnecessary risks.</p>

<p>And, it always helps to have friends and good relationships with the people
who are able to help. The people at Network Solutions and Key Systems were
very helpful in the recovery, as were several other people who keep
the internet working. I wish I could give them direct credit, but I&rsquo;m sure
they&rsquo;d rather do their work quietly.</p>

<h2 id="where-we-are-now">Where we are now</h2>

<p>The Perl.com domain is back in the hands of Tom Christiansen and we&rsquo;re
working on the various security updates so this doesn&rsquo;t happen again. The
website is back to how it was and slightly shinier for the help we received.</p>

<p>As part of the incident response, The Perl Foundation Infrastructure Working
Group surveyed other important community domains and will work to secure those.

<h3>Task 1: Pack a Spiral</h3>
You are given an array @A of items (integers say, but they can be anything).

<p>Your task is to pack that array into an MxN matrix spirally counterclockwise, as tightly as possible.</p>

<p>‘Tightly’ means the absolute value |M-N| of the difference has to be as small as possible.</p>

<pre>
(1..4)  ->  4 3
            1 2
(1..6)  ->  6 5 4   5 4
            1 2 3   6 3
                    1 2
                   
(1..12) ->  9  8  7  6    8  7  6
           10 11 12  5    9 12  5
            1  2  3  4   10 11  4
                          1  2  3
</pre>

<h4>The solution</h4>
No attempting at real <em>golfing</em> this week - but still want to keep it "minimalist"...

<p>Our <code>pack_spiral</code> routine starts by finding the largest factor of the size of the list below sqrt of the size of the list. The two dimensions we will need are this (<code>$rows</code>) and <code>$cols</code>. Just for compactness when printing we chose it so that <code>$rows < $cols</code>.</p>

<p>To compute the number of rows ($rows) this is the largest number < sqrt of the number of elements (N) which is a factor of N. We can use grep to get all factors - if we reverse this the highest factor is the first element of the list...</p>

<pre><code>sub pack_spiral {
  my( $rows )               = reverse grep { ! (@_ % $_) } 1 .. sqrt @_;
  my( $cols, $r, $c, @out ) = ( @_/$rows, $rows-1, -1 );

<p>  while( @_ ) {                                      # do until empty<br />
    $out[ $r ][ ++$c ] = shift foreach 1 .. $cols--; # >><br />
    $out[ --$r ][ $c ] = shift foreach 1 .. --$rows; # ^^<br />
    last                       unless  @_;           # exit if empty<br />
    $out[ $r ][ --$c ] = shift foreach 1 .. $cols--; # <<<br />
    $out[ ++$r ][ $c ] = shift foreach 1 .. --$rows; # vv<br />
  }<br />
  return \@out;<br />
}</code></pre></p>

<p>We work around the spiral starting bottom left - and then work our way right <code>++$c</code>, up <code>--$r</code>, left <code>--$c</code> & down <code>++$r</code>. Each time when we draw one less column (when going left or right) and one less row (when going up or down) - hence the <code>$cols--</code> & <code>--$rows</code>.</p>

<p>Notes: <code>shift</code> by itself shifts off the magic "@_" array - so in our cases takes the next item of the list...</p>

<p>You can see the progress below:<br />

<h3>Task 2: Origin-containing Triangle</h3><br />
You are given three points in the plane, as a list of six co-ordinates: A=(x1,y1), B=(x2,y2) and C=(x3,y3).</p>

<p>Write a script to find out if the triangle formed by the given three co-ordinates contain origin (0,0).</p>

<p>Print 1 if found otherwise 0.</p>

<pre>
Input: A=(0,1) B=(1,0)  C=(2,2)   Output: 0
Input: A=(1,1) B=(-1,1) C=(0,-3)  Output: 1
Input: A=(0,1) B=(2,0)  C=(-6,0)  Output: 1
</pre>

<h4>The solution</h4>
One of the uses I put my degree to at work was to use "Winding numbers" to replicate image maps in web pages {we needed to implement drag features and click feature on an image}... So winding numbers are what I will use here...

<p><em>Winding number</em> - imagine you are a dalek standing at the origin - and you trace around the triangle with your gunstick... If your head turns a full 360 either way then you are in the triangle - if it does not you are outside the triangle! This extends to any shape - you are inside the shape if you take an odd number of turns - outside if you take an even number. The following code is a quick way to compute the winding number.</p>

<p>To include each line - we start with the last point and join it to the first... and then first to second until we finally get back to the line between the last two points.</p>

<pre><code>sub winding_number {
  my ( $a, $b, $wn ) = @_[ -2, -1 ], 0;

<p>  while( my($x,$y) = splice @_, 0, 2 ) {<br />
    $wn += $a<=0 ? $y>0  && $a*$y-$x*$b >  0 ?  1 : 0<br />
                 : $y<=0 && $a*$y-$x*$b <= 0 ? -1 : 0;<br />
    ($a,$b)=($x,$y);<br />
  }<br />
  return $wn%2;<br />
}</code></pre></p>

     <p>Last week, <a href="https://news.perlfoundation.org/post/rt-cpan-org-future">we reported</a> that rt.cpan.org would be moving from its old home, and that it would be hosted by Best Practical, the makers of RT.  The timeline we gave was "will be done sometime in early March," but fortunately, the process has gone very well and is now just about complete.  Within a few hours from now, <a href="https://rt.cpan.org/">rt.cpan.org</a> will point to the new instance, where all the old data has been migrated.  Some small amount of below the surface work remains to be done, but we expect that you should be able to continue using RT without interruption.</p>

<p>You might notice that things look pretty different.  That's because the whole system has been upgraded from v4.0.18 to v5.0.  If you encounter something in the new RT install that used to work and now doesn't, or that just seems plain old broken, please <a href="mailto:rt-cpan-admin@bestpractical.com">contact the rt.cpan.org admins</a>, who can look into it.</p>

<p>Thanks to Best Practical for getting this done without any down time, and of course many thanks to the <a href="https://noc.perl.org/">Perl NOC</a>, who kept our old RT running for so many years!</p>

     <div class="card-body">       <div class="card-text"><p>
Perl is very different from most other programming languages in that functions in Perl can be made aware of their environment, especially they can chechk what kind of data is
expected from them? A scalar, a list? Maybe nothing?
<p>
This expectation might be different every place the function is called. In order to know what is expectation in the current call, the function can use the
slightly incorrectly named <a href="/wantarray">wantarray</a> function.
<p>
However Perl can be a lot more precize telling a function what is expected from it. Using the <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Want">Want</a>
module the function can know exactly how many values it needd to return.

In Perl the <b>our</b> keyword is used to declare one or more package variables. More exactly it creates lexical alias to a packaga variable, but for our practical
purposes <b>our</b> means we are allowed to use the package variable without giving the fully qualified name and without violating the rules
of <a href="/strict">use strict</a>.
<p>
With that out of the way, in most cases, you'd want to declare variables in a lexical scope using the <a href="/my">my</a> keyword.

There are also package variables in Perl that are declared using the <a href="/our">our</a> keyword.

            </div> <!-- card-header -->
     <div class="card-body">       <div class="card-text"><p>We sent the below email to all the CPAN Mirror contacts yesterday:</p><blockquote style="border: none; margin: 0px 0px 0px 40px; padding: 0px; text-align: left;"><h1 style="text-align: justify;">An Important Update about the CPAN Mirror List</h1><p style="text-align: justify;">You're receiving this email because you're listed as a contact point for a CPAN mirror. Thank you! The mirror network has been a huge part of CPAN’s success. Soon, the way clients use CPAN mirrors is changing. You don't need to do anything, but after reading this email, you might want to.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Some background: For a long time, when the CPAN client (aka CPAN.pm) started up for the first time, it prompted users to configure it by picking a nearby mirror. The assumption was that it would be best to find a geographically nearby mirror. This necessitated the keeping of a central list of mirrors which the client could retrieve and offer as a menu. That's the CPAN Mirror List, maintained by the Perl NOC.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In 2011, the client changed behavior to configure itself automatically, meaning that most new users never saw this list. Furthermore, www.cpan.org was pointed at a global CDN, meaning that traffic could be routed efficiently without client configuration. The CDN also meant that users wouldn’t need to worry about out of date or down mirrors..</p><p style="text-align: justify;">After ten years of CPAN defaulting to the CDN, we are going to stop maintaining the mirror list. It will still be present, but have only one entry: www.cpan.org. This means that anyone attempting to pick a mirror from the list will only find this one option. The mirror status site will be replaced with a static page. As has always been the case, the CPAN client can be configured manually to use any mirror, whether or not it's on the mirror list.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Users who have configured their CPAN clients to point at your mirror will continue to hit it. No new users are likely to find it -- but after all, they were already very unlikely to do so! That said, you do not need to shut down your mirror. If you use your mirror, you can keep mirroring. We’re not removing or changing the ability to mirror. If you know you have users of your mirror who would like to keep using it, please feel free to keep mirroring it.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">On the other hand, if you would like to stop mirroring CPAN, feel free to do that, too. Clients have always had to deal with their mirror going away, and they will be fine if you choose to shut down your mirror.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">We have not set a firm date for the emptying of the mirror list, but we expect it to happen no earlier than mid-February and no later than June 2021.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">If you have any questions, please email us at &lt;cpan at perl.org&gt;.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Concerned this is fake? A copy of this email can be found at https://log.perl.org/2021/02/cpan-mirror-list-changes.html.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Finally: Thanks! The mirror network helped make CPAN practical for many years, and CPAN helped make Perl a success. You were part of this endeavor, and we appreciate it!<span style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;</span></p></blockquote><blockquote style="border: none; margin: 0px 0px 0px 40px; padding: 0px; text-align: left;"><p style="text-align: justify;"><span face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="background-color: white; color: #222222; font-size: small;">-- The&nbsp;</span><span class="il" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="background-color: white; color: #222222; font-size: small;">CPAN</span><span face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="background-color: white; color: #222222; font-size: small;">&nbsp;</span><span class="il" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="background-color: white; color: #222222; font-size: small;">Mirror</span><span face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="background-color: white; color: #222222; font-size: small;">&nbsp;</span><span class="il" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="background-color: white; color: #222222; font-size: small;">List</span><span face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="background-color: white; color: #222222; font-size: small;">&nbsp;</span><span face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="background-color: white; color: #222222; font-size: small;">Admins</span></p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p>       </div><!-- card-text -->     </div>

            </div> <!-- card-header -->
     <div class="card-body">       <div class="card-text">
        <p>These are some answers to the Week 100 of the <a href="https://perlweeklychallenge.org/blog/perl-weekly-challenge-100/">Perl Weekly Challenge</a> organized by <a href="http://blogs.perl.org/users/mohammad_s_anwar/">Mohammad S. Anwar</a>.</p>

<h2>Task 1: Fun Time</h2>

<p><em>You are given a time (12 hour / 24 hour).</em></p>

<p><em>Write a script to convert the given time from 12 hour format to 24 hour format and vice versa.</em></p>

<p><em>Ideally we expect a one-liner.</em></p>

<p><em>Example 1:</em></p>

<pre><code>Input: 05:15 pm or 05:15pm
Output: 17:15
</code></pre>

<p><em>Example 2:</em></p>

<pre><code>Input: 19:15
Output: 07:15 pm or 07:15pm
</code></pre>

<p>Well, I like concise code, but I don&#8217;t think it makes real sense to try to pack this task into a one-liner. I have no doubt that it can be done, but it will either be not a real one-liner (like a pipeline chaining multiple statements into one expression), or a difficult to understand golfing attempt. So, I will not try to do a one-liner.</p>

<h3>Fun Time in Raku</h3>

<p>We use a regex to detect whether the input string matches &#8220;am&#8221; or &#8220;pm&#8221;; if so, we remove that &#8220;am&#8221; or &#8220;pm&#8221; string and add 12 hours if the matched string was &#8220;pm&#8221;; otherwise, we subtract 12 from the hour part it if is larger than 12 and add &#8220;pm&#8221; or &#8220;am&#8221; depending on the case. </p>

<pre><code>use v6;

my $time = @*ARGS[0];
if $time ~~ /(&lt;[ap]&gt;)m/ {
    if $0 eq 'a'  {
        $time ~~ s/(\d\d':'\d\d).*/$0/;
    } else {
        $time ~~ s/(\d\d)':'(\d\d).*/{$0 + 12}:$1/;
    }
} else {
    $time ~~ /^(\d\d)':'(\d\d)/;
    my ($suffix, $hour) = $0 &gt; 12 ?? ('pm', $0 - 12) !! ('am', $0);
    $time = "$hour:$1 $suffix";
}
say $time;
</code></pre>

<p>These are some execution examples with various input strings:</p>

<pre><code>$ raku fun-time.raku '10:54'
10:54 am
-
$ raku fun-time.raku '17:54'
5:54 pm
-
$ raku fun-time.raku '10:54 pm'
22:54
-
$ raku fun-time.raku '10:54 am'
10:54
</code></pre>

<h3>Fun Time in Perl</h3>

<p>This is a port to Perl of the Raku program just above:</p>

<pre><code>use strict;
use warnings;
use feature "say";

my $time = shift;
if ($time =~ /([ap])m/) {
    if ($1 eq 'a')  {
        $time =~ s/(\d\d:\d\d).*/$1/;
    } else {
        $time =~ /(\d\d):(\d\d.).*/;
        my $hour = $1 + 12;
        $time = "$hour:$2";
    }
} else {
    $time =~ /^(\d\d):(\d\d)/;
    my ($suffix, $hour) = $1 &gt; 12 ? ('pm', $1 - 12) : ('am', $1);
    $time = "$hour:$2 $suffix";
}
say $time;
</code></pre>

<p>And some execution examples:</p>

<pre><code>$ perl fun-time.pl '10:54 pm'
22:54

$ perl fun-time.pl '10:54 am'
10:54

$ perl fun-time.pl '10:54'
10:54 am

$ perl fun-time.pl '15:54'
3:54 pm
</code></pre>

<h2>Task 2: Triangle Sum</h2>

<p><em>You are given triangle array.</em></p>

<p><em>Write a script to find the minimum path sum from top to bottom.</em></p>

<p><em>When you are on index i on the current row then you may move to either index i or index i + 1 on the next row.</em></p>

<p><em>Example 1:</em></p>

<pre><code>Input: Triangle = [ [1], [2,4], [6,4,9], [5,1,7,2] ]
Output: 8

Explanation: The given triangle

            1
           2 4
          6 4 9
         5 1 7 2

The minimum path sum from top to bottom:  1 + 2 + 4 + 1 = 8

             [1]
           [2]  4
           6 [4] 9
          5 [1] 7 2
</code></pre>

<p><em>Example 2:</em></p>

<pre><code>Input: Triangle = [ [3], [3,1], [5,2,3], [4,3,1,3] ]
Output: 7

Explanation: The given triangle

            3
           3 1
          5 2 3
         4 3 1 3

The minimum path sum from top to bottom: 3 + 1 + 2 + 1 = 7

             [3]
            3  [1]
           5 [2] 3
          4 3 [1] 3
</code></pre>

<h3>Triangle Sum in Raku</h3>

<p>We use the <code>traverse</code> recursive subroutine to find the smallest path through the triangular array:</p>

<pre><code>use v6;

my @triangle = (1), (2,4), (6,4,9), (5,1,7,2);
my @min-path = map { $_[0] }, @triangle; # pick any path
my $min-path-val = @min-path.sum;
my $index = 0;
traverse @triangle, (), $index;
say @min-path;

sub traverse (@triangle, @path, $index) {
    my @first-line = @triangle[0];
    my @new-triangle = @triangle[1 .. @triangle.end];
    say "First-line: ", @first-line;
    my @new-path = | (@path, @first-line[$index]);
    say @new-path, "  ", "\n";
    if @new-triangle.elems &gt; 0 {
        traverse(@new-triangle, @new-path, $index);
        traverse(@new-triangle, @new-path, $index + 1);
    } else {
        my $new-path-val = @new-path.sum;
        if $new-path-val &lt; $min-path-val {
            @min-path = @new-path;
            $min-path-val = $new-path-val
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Output:</p>

<p>$ raku triangle-sum.raku
1 2 4 1</p>

<h3>Triangle Sum in Perl</h3>

<p>Except for the fact that we define also a <code>sum</code> subroutine, this essentially the same Raku algorithm ported to Perl:</p>

<pre><code>use strict;
use warnings;
use feature "say";

my $triangle = [ [1], [2,4], [6,4,9], [5,1,7,2] ];
# $triangle = [ [1], [2,4], [6,30,9], [30,30,30,2] ];
my $min_path = [ map { $_-&gt;[0] } @$triangle];
my $min_path_val = sum($min_path);
my $index = 0;
find_min_path($triangle, [], $index);
say "@$min_path";

sub sum {
    my $aref = shift;
    my $sum = 0;
    $sum += $_ for @$aref;
    return $sum;
}

sub find_min_path {
    my ($tri_ref, $path, $index) = @_;
    my @triangle = @$tri_ref;
    my @first_row = @{$triangle[0]};
    my @new_triangle = @triangle[1 .. $#triangle];
    my $new_path = [ @$path, $first_row[$index] ];
    if (@new_triangle) {
        find_min_path([@new_triangle], $new_path , $index);
        find_min_path([@new_triangle], $new_path, $index + 1);
    } else { 
        my $new_path_val = sum($new_path);
        if ($new_path_val &lt; $min_path_val) {
            $min_path = $new_path;
            $min_path_val = $new_path_val;
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Output with the above input data:</p>

<pre><code>$ perl  triangle-sum.pl
1 2 4 1
</code></pre>

<p>If you uncomment the second triangle definition, you get the following output:</p>

<pre><code>$ perl  triangle-sum.pl
1 4 9 2
</code></pre>

<p>Ok, so this isn;t going to win and <em>Perl Golf</em> competitions, that’s for sure! Frankly, this approach using regexes might not be the best for succinctly handling the bi-directionality.</p>
<p>For anyone that might not be familiar <code>shift=~/(\d+):(\d\d\s*((am|pm)))/</code> means <em>shift the first argument off of <span class="citation" data-cites="ARGV">@ARGV</span> (the command line arguments and then match against the regex.</em> This is equivalent to <code>$ARGV[0]=~/(\d+):(\d\d\s*((am|pm)))/</code>.</p>

     <p>Last year The Perl Foundation participated in <a href="https://www.outreachy.org/">Outreachy</a> May to August internships and <a href="https://news.perlfoundation.org/post/outreach-2020-complete">it was successfully completed</a>. We are looking to participate again this year.</p>

<p>At this stage we are looking for mentors and project ideas from the Perl and Raku community. If you are interested in becoming a mentor, please read the <a href="https://www.outreachy.org/mentor/#mentor">Mentor description</a> and add your ideas at <a href="https://github.com/perl-foundation-outreach/outreachy-2020-ideas">our repo</a>. We plan to close our internal submission process on February 28th. Note that mentors are expected to spend 5-10 hours per week during the program period.</p>

<p>We also have a Perl/Raku Outreachy discussion forum at <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/perl-foundation-outreach">Google Groups</a>.</p>

<p>Outreachy, formerly The Outreach Program for Women, was started by the GNOME Foundation in 2006 to encourage women to participate in the GNOME project. Since inception the project has grown to include many Free and Open Source organisations, including The Perl Foundation, and now the program has been rebranded and extended to encourage the participation of other underrepresented groups.</p>

<p>Outreachy explicitly invites applicants from around the world who are women (cis and trans), trans men, and genderqueer people. Additionally, they explicitly invite residents and nationals of the United States of any gender who are Black/African American, Hispanic/Latino, American Indian, Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian, or Pacific Islander. Anyone who faces systemic bias or discrimination in the technology industry of their country is invited to apply.  </p>

     <p>Happy to announce that Jonathan was able to resume work on his Raku Development Grant. 
Here is his report. </p>

<p><hr>
In January, I at last felt in shape to get back to the new dispatch mechanism. The key remaining piece of the mechanism is <em>dispatch resumption</em> - a general term I'm using for a range of situations where we start doing some kind of dispatch, and may continue it later. For example:</p>

<ul>
<li>When we call a method, we might later use <code>callsame</code> or similar in order to call a method in the base class (strictly, given multiple inheritance, the next method in the method resolution order)</li>
<li>When we use <code>wrap</code>, we also use <code>callsame</code> to call the wrapped code (and there may be any number of wrappers)</li>
<li>When we call a multi candidate, we can also use <code>callsame</code> to defer to the next best one</li>
<li>When we have a <code>proto</code> <code>sub</code> or <code>method</code> with a body, we need to run that body before we proceed with the multi-dispatch</li>
<li>Today, when we have a multi-dispatch with <code>where</code> clauses or unpacks, we need to do a test bind of the signature to see if the candidate is valid, followed by doing the invocation. This creates duplicate work. A better way would be to just try calling the candidate and having a way to treat a failure in parameter binding as a dispatch resumption, at which point we'd just continue with the next candidate.</li>
</ul>

<p>Having an intuition that these can be neatly handled as cases of the same thing is rather easier, however, than coming up with a design to make it happen! Last year, before I had to take a break from my work on this, I had a number of false starts: designs that were partly right, and gave me some things to implement, but that all ran into problems.</p>

<p>Finally, I believe I've got a design that holds up. While that was still a quite theoretical claim at the end of January, I'm writing this report mid-February, by which point I've got a significant amount of the desgin implemented and working. Despite the fact that the specializer has not yet learned about this aspect of the new dispatch mechanism, I'm still seeing speedups of a factor of about 7 in a <code>callsame</code> to parent <code>method</code> benchmark (with 4 levels of inheritance), and a factor of 10 in a benchmark involving a subroutine with a single wrapper. I had planned to accompany this report with a link to a blog post with further technical details and the benchmarks; unfortunately, that's been delayed thanks to an injured arm (which I hope is now on the mend, although I should still keep my keyboard time down a bit for the days to come).</p>

<p>I actually did this two different ways. The first follows the letter of the challenge as to the parameters of the <code>read_n</code> function and the second differs, only passing in <code>$number</code> and does not include the filename.</p>
<p>Before I get into the differences it makes sense to point out how <code>read_maker0()</code> works. What is does is create a closure over the value <code>$n</code> which will hold the current position in the file. Think of the variable <code>$n</code> created in <code>read_maker0()</code> as <em>captured</em> inside the function that is being returned. This process is called <em>currying</em> and it’s a neat trick. I’ve used it in the past for these challenges, the first being way back in <a href="https://adamcrussell.livejournal.com/948.html">Challenge 003</a>! In this way <code>read_maker0()</code> is creating the function which we are referring to by the scalar <code>$read_n</code>.</p>
<p>After each <a href="https://perldoc.perl.org/functions/read">read</a> <code>$n</code> is incremented and used to <a href="https://perldoc.perl.org/functions/seek">seek</a> to the next position. I should note that this is not really necessary here since the value of <code>$number</code> is never changed. In this case the <code>read</code> alone will advance the file position as necessary. However, by including <code>seek</code> the solution is more general. We would be able to move around the file however we want, backwards and forwards, with <code>seek</code> if we wanted to.</p>
<p>So we see that we can capture <code>$n</code> and use it to store the file position between function calls. The challenge states that we are to called <code>read_n</code> with two parameters, the filename and the number of characters to read. As you can see, we do not need to keep sending the filename with each function call. The filename can also be a part of the closure!</p>
<p>That is the difference between <code>read_maker0()</code> and <code>read_maker1()</code>. The first returns a <code>read_n</code> function that matches the challenge specification of taking a filename and a number of characters to read. <code>read_maker1()</code> returns a function that only takes the number of characters to read, the function itself has a stored value for the file handle we want.</p>
<p>One small final thing to mention: anyone unfamiliar with <code>read</code> might notice that there is no checking to see if we attempt to read past the end of the file. That is because <code>read</code> will read all the characters it can and if it hits the end of the file it will stop. The return value from <code>read</code> is the number of characters successfully read. While we do not check that value in this code, if we did we would see that in this example the final read would return 2, which is clear in the output shown.</p>

<p>While somewhat convoluted sounding at first this part of Challenge 098 ended up being fairly straightforward, especially when using <a href="https://perldoc.perl.org/functions/splice">splice</a> to do any array insertions. Probably there are more “fun” ways to have done this but the intuitive way here has an almost comforting look to it. Reminds me of university computer lab exercises!</p>
<p>Anyway, the approach here is to consider the possible cases. <code>find_insert</code> starts off by checking to see if <code>$n</code> would belong at the very start or end of the array. If neither of those cases hold we loop over the array looking for where <code>$n</code> might be. If found in the array we return with the index, else we insert with <code>splice</code>.</p>
<p>The challenge never asks to see the modified array so I suppose it is possible to merely return where <code>$n</code> belongs without actually inserting it but that didn’t seem quite as sporting.</p>
