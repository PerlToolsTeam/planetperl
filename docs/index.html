            </div> <!-- card-header -->
     <div class="card-body">       <div class="card-text">
        <p>This is a variant of <a href="https://semver.org/">SemVer</a> which mostly meets all its rules, except for releases prior to 0.2.0, where we bend them slightly.</p>

<p>It is my intention to use this versioning system for all open source software I develop from 1 January 2023 onwards. Existing open source projects I manage will adopt this scheme from their next release onwards. (<a href="https://typetiny.toby.ink">Type::Tiny</a> already somewhat does.)</p>

        <ul>
<li><p>Like with SemVer, versions have three parts: MAJOR, MINOR, and PATCH.</p>
<li><p>Adopting a common pattern that many projects use (including Linux), versions with an odd-numbered MINOR part are considered unstable.</p>
<li><p>During unstable development periods (i.e. odd-numbered minor versions), you can add new features, break backwards compatibility, etc as much as you like. This <em>would</em> violate SemVer, except...</p>
<li><p>All unstable development releases must have a pre-release identifier such as <code>-dev</code> applied to them. SemVer explicitly states:</p><blockquote><p>"A pre-release version indicates that the version is unstable and might not satisfy the intended compatibility requirements as denoted by its associated normal version."</p></blockquote>
<li><p>As an exception, 0.1.x releases should not be assumed to have a stable API at all, and thus do not need <code>-dev</code> suffixes.</p>
<li><p>At the end of an unstable development cycle, for example, 0.5.x versions, the developers should judge whether to release the next stable release as 0.6.0 or 1.0.0 based on how much it differs with the 0.4.x versions, as if the 0.5.x versions never happened.</p>
</ul>

<h2>Example</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>The first release of a project would be 0.1.0. This would be unstable.</p></li>
<li><p>The next release of a project would be 0.1.1. This would also be unstable and could include breaking changes.</p></li>
<li><p>Perhaps now there has been sufficient experimentation, so the next version would be 0.2.0 and would be considered stable.</p></li>
<li><p>Version 0.2.1 might include bug fixes but no breaking changes.</p></li>
<li><p>New features are desired, so 0.3.0-dev is released with a first draft of these features.</p></li>
<li><p>0.3.1-dev, 0.3.2-dev, and 0.3.3-dev follow swiftly after.</p></li>
<li><p>The new features are judged to be stable enough. The developers must then decide whether the next release will retain compatibility with 0.2.x (and thus be called 0.4.0) or break compatibility (and thus warrant a bump to 1.0.0).</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Decimal Variation</h2>

<p>Although dotted version numbers like 1.2.3 are supported by most of the Perl toolchain, simple decimals with a single dot are more commonly used. So an interpretation of the above using simple decimals is desired. The MAJOR part of the version number translates to units, MINOR to thousandths, and PATCH to millionths. So version 1.2.3 becomes 1.002003.</p>

<p>In Perl it is also common to use an underscore in the version number to indicate an unstable release. For example version 1.3.2 might be 1.003_002.</p>

        <h3>A Fool's Errand, and Quantum Theory</h3>

<p>It is my firm belief that every thought or idea that you or I have,  has been had before. On the balance of statistics, the chances are that those that had these ideas handled it better,  and have developed more powerful utilities to exploit these innovations.  One therefore has a few possible options, when thinking of creating a solution to a problem. The first probably is to look for other published solutions and use them; these may be more mature, tried, tested and optimised.  The second is to go ahead and implement another idea, foolishly perceived as an innovation,  leading to a proliferation of methods duplicating, triplicating existing work, in the end producing a half-baked distraction.</p>

<p>Statistics indicate that someone will take that path of the fool. I am not going to argue with Quantum Programmodynamics; if it has to be someone, let it be me. Interaction in console applications may involve the ping-pong between a script and STDIN. It may be more sophisticated using <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Curses::UI">Curses::UI</a>. This is established, used for heavyweight applications and has a superb feature set. It could be more modern using <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Tickit">Tickit</a> by Perl's resident genius and author of over 235 Perl modules, Paul Evans; powerful, versatile, event-aware and handled in a Perlish way, Tickit is the API for the future of Perl console applications. Or one could try and invent something different. Not better, not more powerful, not more elegant. Just different. Why? Quantum, that's why.</p>

<p>There may be reasons other than pure bloody mindedness or foolishness for doing something differently.  Indeed, perhaps the only way to learn to appreciate the right way,  is to do the wrong thing. Honestly. </p>

<h3>Interactive Applications with Term::Graille</h3>

<p><a href="https://github.com/saiftynet/Term-Graille">Term::Graille</a> offers pseudo-pixel graphics to the standard ANSI console, now is acquiring interaction tools. Interaction is handled primarily by the <a href="module. As before, [Term::Graille](https://metacpan.org/pod/Term::Graille">Term::Graille::Interact</a> tries to to remain as "Pure Perl" as possible, and minimise reliance on external libraries. Interaction is via a keyboard, and thus uses <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Term::ReadKey">Term::ReadKey</a>. Rather than using <a href="https://metacpan.org/dist/EV/view/libev/ev.pod">libev</a>/EVent, it relies on querying the keyboard every so often (default every 50 milliseconds)  and dispatches predefined actions depending on the result...a rather old-fashioned way of doing things</p>

<p>One adds key-triggered actions, using <code>addAction()</code>, for each key of interest, passing it a subroutine reference and a description. One can also add various widget objects which temporarily override these actions when they are active using <code>addObject()</code>. There may be actions that occur when without a key press. These can also be added using <code>updateAction()</code>.</p>

<p>The best way to demonstrate this is through game development. Term:: Graille's  graphical capabilities combined with interaction equals a simple gaming platform. Games may need Sprites, and a Sprite Maker application can also demonstrate interacting capabilities. A glimpse of an early version of such an application was seen in a <a href="https://blogs.perl.org/users/saif/2022/09/death-a-terminal-experience.html">previous blog post</a>, and discussed in more detail later. </p>

<h3>Invading My Space</h3>

<p>One simple game is <a href="https://github.com/saiftynet/Term-Graille/blob/main/examples/invaders.pl">Space Invaders</a>. Shapes are loaded.  Sprites are created with shape, location and velocity,  and stored in an array.  Some move by themselves,  others move on user key-presses, others are generated, do their thing and vanish. Our defender's motion uses arrow keys. The aliens and the rockets move autonomously and the graille canvas is updated at regular intervals. (Fonts, Sound and collision detection can be subject of later scrutiny). </p>

<p>One creates an interaction object,  adds actions <code>addAction()</code> triggered either by a key, or spontaneously every cycle (<code>updateAction()</code>), and then gets it running.</p>

<pre><code>my $io=Term::Graille::Interact-&gt;new(); # a new Interact Object
$io-&gt;{debugCursor}=[22,45];            # output for debugging

$io-&gt;addAction(undef,"[D",{note=&gt;"Move Left ",proc=&gt;sub{
$defender-&gt;{x}=$defender-&gt;{x}&gt;=1?$defender-&gt;{x}-1:1 }} );

$io-&gt;addAction(undef,"[C",{note=&gt;"Move Right ",proc=&gt;sub{
$defender-&gt;{x}=$defender-&gt;{x}&lt;=65?$defender-&gt;{x}+1:65 }} );

$io-&gt;addAction(undef,"[A",{note=&gt;"Fire      ",     proc=&gt;sub{
push @missiles,{sprite=&gt;"patriot",x=&gt;$defender-&gt;{x}+4,y=&gt;1,dy=&gt;1};
$beep-&gt;playSound(undef,"A#1");}}  );

$io-&gt;addAction(undef,"p",{note=&gt;"PAUSE ",     proc=&gt;sub{
    $stopUpdates=$stopUpdates?0:1;}}    );

$io-&gt;updateAction(\&amp;update);  # this action is executed every read key cycle
$io-&gt;run();              # this starts the interaction.
</code></pre>

<p>This can yields the interaction component of a simple test 1st game for the PerlayStation Terminal Games Console. There is prior art, of course: these are better than mine. Here is <a href="https://www.perlmonks.org/?node_id=169437">one by a Perl Monk called domm</a>  who also did <a href="https://github.com/domm/Game-PerlInvaders">a version  using SDL</a>  and <a href="https://metacpan.org/dist/CECALA/view/spaceInvaders.pl">one in Tk by CECALA</a> </p>

     <div class="card-body">       <div class="card-text"><p>Perl has several modules on several levels of abstraction to interact with web sites using HTTP requests. One of the nice modules is <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/WWW::Mechanize">WWW::Mechanize</a> that is built on top of <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/LWP::UserAgent">LWP::UserAgent</a>. In this example we'll see how to set the header in the HTTP request using WWW::Mechanize.</p>

<p>We'll use the service provided by the <a href="https://httpbin.org/">httpbin.org</a> web site to see the headers we set.</p>

<p>It has many end-points. We use the one that will send back the header the client sent as its content. It makes it very easy to see what was in our header.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  Headers by Firefox on Ubuntu
</h2>

<p>If you visit <a href="https://httpbin.org/headers">https://httpbin.org/headers</a> with your browser it will show you the headers your browser sent. For example I use FireFox on Ubuntu and this is the response I received:<br>
</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight json"><code><span class="p">{</span><span class="w">

</span><span class="p">}</span><span class="w">
</span></code></pre>

</div>



<p>From this we can see that my browser identified itself as <code>Mozilla/5.0</code></p>

<h2>
  
  
  Headers by curl
</h2>

<p>I also tried <a href="https://curl.se/">curl</a>:<br>
</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>curl https://httpbin.org/headers
</code></pre>

</div>



<p>This is what I received:<br>
</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight json"><code><span class="p">{</span><span class="w">
  </span><span class="nl">"headers"</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span><span class="w">

    </span><span class="nl">"User-Agent"</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">"curl/7.81.0"</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w">

  </span><span class="p">}</span><span class="w">
</span><span class="p">}</span><span class="w">
</span></code></pre>

</div>



<p>So curl identified itself as "curl/7.81.0".</p>

<h2>
  
  
  Simple request with WWW::Mechanize
</h2>

<p>In order to use this code you will first need to install WWW::Mechanize. You can probably do it using<br>
</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>cpanm WWW::Mechanize
</code></pre>

</div>



<p>This is a simple sample code:<br>
</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight perl"><code><span class="k">use</span> <span class="nv">strict</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="k">use</span> <span class="nv">warnings</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="k">use</span> <span class="nv">feature</span> <span class="p">'</span><span class="s1">say</span><span class="p">';</span>

<span class="k">use</span> <span class="nn">WWW::</span><span class="nv">Mechanize</span><span class="p">;</span>

<span class="k">my</span> <span class="nv">$url</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">'</span><span class="s1">https://httpbin.org/headers</span><span class="p">';</span>

<span class="k">my</span> <span class="nv">$mech</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nn">WWW::</span><span class="nv">Mechanize</span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="k">new</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="nv">$mech</span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="nv">get</span><span class="p">(</span> <span class="nv">$url</span> <span class="p">);</span>
<span class="nv">say</span> <span class="nv">$mech</span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="nv">status</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="nv">say</span> <span class="p">'</span><span class="s1">---</span><span class="p">';</span>
<span class="nv">say</span> <span class="nv">$mech</span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="nv">dump_headers</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="nv">say</span> <span class="p">'</span><span class="s1">---</span><span class="p">';</span>
<span class="nv">say</span> <span class="nv">$mech</span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="nv">content</span><span class="p">;</span>

</code></pre>

</div>



<p>The result includes 3 sections divided by some dashes.</p>

<p>First we printed the HTTP status code the server set. It was 200 OK.</p>

<p>The second part is the HTTP header the server set. This was shown by using the <code>dump_headers</code> method.</p>

<p>Finally we have the content of the page that is set to the header our client sent. This is what we saw earlier.<br>
In this output you can see that the Perl module identified as "WWW-Mechanize/2.06".<br>
</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>200

  }
}
</code></pre>

</div>



<h2>
  
  
  How to set HTTP head sent by the client
</h2>

<p>Finally we got to the code that changes the header of the request.</p>

<p>It is basically the same code as we had earlier, but now we called the <code>add_header</code> method twice<br>
with key-value pairs.<br>
</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight perl"><code><span class="k">use</span> <span class="nv">strict</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="k">use</span> <span class="nv">warnings</span><span class="p">;</span>

<span class="nv">$mech</span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="nv">get</span><span class="p">(</span> <span class="nv">$url</span> <span class="p">);</span>
<span class="c1">#say $mech-&gt;status;</span>
<span class="c1">#say '---';</span>
<span class="c1">#say $mech-&gt;dump_headers;</span>
<span class="c1">#say '---';</span>
<span class="nv">say</span> <span class="nv">$mech</span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="nv">content</span><span class="p">;</span>
</code></pre>

</div>



<p>The result looks like this:</p>

<p>The first 2 parts were the same as previously so I commented out those to focus on the header that was sent by our Perl code:<br>
</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight json"><code><span class="p">{</span><span class="w">
  </span><span class="nl">"headers"</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span><span class="w">
    </span><span class="nl">"Accept-Encoding"</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">"gzip"</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w">
    </span><span class="nl">"Api-Key"</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">"Some API key"</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w">
    </span><span class="nl">"Host"</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">"httpbin.org"</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w">
    </span><span class="nl">"User-Agent"</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">"Internet Explorer/6.0"</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w">
    </span><span class="nl">"X-Amzn-Trace-Id"</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">"Root=1-63a98bea-425a9c414e57cf3f42335fa4"</span><span class="w">
  </span><span class="p">}</span><span class="w">
</span><span class="p">}</span><span class="w">
</span></code></pre>

</div>



<p>Here you can see that the "Api-Key" field was added and the "User-Agent" field was replaced by a value we provided.</p>

<p>It is not widely known that Perl is one of the easiest languages to read like Python, while the information that Python is the most readable programming language is widely circulated, with no confirmation of its veracity.</p>

<p>To resolve this misunderstanding, let me write one code.<br>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>use v5.36;

while (my $line = &lt;DATA&gt;) {
  chomp $line;

  my ($id, $name, $price) = split(',', $line);

  my $new_line = join(' ', $id, $name, $price);

  say $new_line;
}

__DATA__
1,Perl,2000
2,Database,3000
3,Web,4000
</code></pre>

</div>



<p>Result:<br>
</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>1 Perl 2000

     <div class="card-body">       <div class="card-text"><p><a href="https://cpan-digger.perlmaven.com/">CPAN Digger</a> has a never ending 3rd party Perl libraries, many without any CI configured. This time I picked the one called <a href="https://metacpan.org/dist/Data-Alias">Data::Alias</a>.</p>

<p>At first I sent a "standard" configuration of GitHub Actions, but then I noticed 2 things. Some tests were dependent on some extra modules and some tests needed a threaded Perl. Apparently the one that I used in my "standard" configuration isn't. So In addition to the execution of the CI on Ubuntu, macOS and Windows natively, I've also added another job in which we use a perl-based Docker image and run the tests there. In this case one of the tags I used from <a href="https://hub.docker.com/_/perl">Perl on Docker Hub</a> was the <code>5.36-threaded</code>.</p>

<p>I was happy to see that the tests passed on every platform and on every version of Perl I tried.</p>

<p>I sent the <a href="https://github.com/mvduin/perl-Data-Alias/pull/3">pull-request</a></p>

     <div class="card-body">       <div class="card-text"><p><a href="https://chat.openai.com/chat">ChatGPT</a> exposes an API, but there&#8217;s no CPAN module for taking advantage of that. Let&#8217;s put that right (with help from ChatGPT)&#8230;</p>
<hr />
<p><em>Write a Perl CPAN module for connecting to a ChatGPT server</em></p>
<p>To create a Perl CPAN module for connecting to a ChatGPT server, you will need to have Perl and the necessary dependencies installed on your system.</p>
<p>To begin, create a new directory for your module and create a file called &#8220;ChatGPT.pm&#8221; with the following content:</p><pre class="urvanov-syntax-highlighter-plain-tag">package ChatGPT;

use strict;
use warnings;

use Net::WebSocket::Client;
use Net::WebSocket::Server;
use HTTP::Async;

sub new {
  my ($class, %params) = @_;
  my $self = {
    host =&gt; $params{host},
    port =&gt; $params{port},
  };

  bless $self, $class;

  return $self;
}

sub send_prompt {
  my ($self, $prompt) = @_;

  my $http = HTTP::Async-&gt;new;
  my $client = Net::WebSocket::Client-&gt;new(
    url =&gt; "ws://$self-&gt;{host}:$self-&gt;{port}"
  );

  $client-&gt;connect;
  $client-&gt;send_utf8($prompt);

  my $response = $client-&gt;recv;

  $client-&gt;disconnect;

  return $response;
}

1;</pre><p>To use this module in your Perl code, you can create a new ChatGPT object and call the <code>send_prompt</code> method like this:</p><pre class="urvanov-syntax-highlighter-plain-tag">use ChatGPT;

my $chatgpt = ChatGPT-&gt;new(host =&gt; 'localhost', port =&gt; 8080);
my $response = $chatgpt-&gt;send_prompt('What is your name?');
print "Response: $response\n";</pre><p>This will send the text prompt &#8220;What is your name?&#8221; to the ChatGPT server running on localhost at port 8080, and print the response to the console.</p>
<p>Note: This is just a basic example of how you can create a Perl CPAN module for connecting to a ChatGPT server. There are many other features and considerations that you may want to add to your module, such as error handling and customization options.</p>
<p>To make your module available on CPAN, you will need to follow the guidelines for creating and distributing CPAN modules, which can be found in the Perl documentation and online resources.</p>
<p><em>Use Moose to create the class</em></p>
<p>To use Moose to create the <code>ChatGPT</code> class, you will need to have Moose installed on your system. You can install Moose by running the following command:</p><pre class="urvanov-syntax-highlighter-plain-tag">cpanm Moose</pre><p>With Moose installed, you can modify the class like this:</p><pre class="urvanov-syntax-highlighter-plain-tag">package ChatGPT;

use Moose;
use Net::WebSocket::Client;
use Net::WebSocket::Server;
use HTTP::Async;

has host =&gt; (
  is =&gt; 'ro',
  isa =&gt; 'Str',
  required =&gt; 1,
);

has port =&gt; (
  is =&gt; 'ro',
  isa =&gt; 'Int', required =&gt; 1,
);

sub send_prompt {
  my ($self, $prompt) = @_;

  my $http = HTTP::Async-&gt;new;
  my $client = Net::WebSocket::Client-&gt;new(
    url =&gt; "ws://$self-&gt;{host}:$self-&gt;{port}"
  );

  $client-&gt;connect; $client-&gt;send_utf8($prompt);
  my $response = $client-&gt;recv;
  $client-&gt;disconnect;

  return $response;
}

1;</pre><p>In this version of the class, the <code>host</code> and <code>port</code> attributes are defined using Moose&#8217;s <code>has</code> keyword. These attributes are required and must be specified when creating a new <code>ChatGPT</code> object. The <code>send_prompt</code> method is unchanged from the previous example.</p>
<p>To create a new <code>ChatGPT</code> object, you can use the <code>new</code> method provided by Moose like this:</p><pre class="urvanov-syntax-highlighter-plain-tag">use ChatGPT;

my $chatgpt = ChatGPT-&gt;new(host =&gt; 'localhost', port =&gt; 8080);

my $response = $chatgpt-&gt;send_prompt('What is your name?');

print "Response: $response\n";</pre><p>This will create a new <code>ChatGPT</code> object with the specified <code>host</code> and <code>port</code> attributes, and send the text prompt &#8220;What is your name?&#8221; to the ChatGPT server running on localhost at port 8080. The response will be printed to the console.</p>
<p>Note: This is just one way to use Moose to create the <code>ChatGPT</code> class. There are many other features and customization options available in Moose that you may want to consider adding to your class, such as type constraints, default values, and methods.</p>
<p><em>Call the class WebService::ChatGPT</em></p>
<p>To rename the <code>ChatGPT</code> class to <code>WebService::ChatGPT</code>, you will need to update the package name at the top of the file and update the <code>use</code> statements to refer to the new package name.</p>
<p>Here is how you can update the <code>ChatGPT</code> class to use the new package name:</p><pre class="urvanov-syntax-highlighter-plain-tag">package WebService::ChatGPT;

use Moose;
use Net::WebSocket::Client;
use Net::WebSocket::Server;

use HTTP::Async;

has host =&gt; (
  is =&gt; 'ro',
  isa =&gt; 'Str',
  required =&gt; 1,
);

has port =&gt; (
  is =&gt; 'ro',
  isa =&gt; 'Int',
  required =&gt; 1,
);

sub send_prompt {
  my ($self, $prompt) = @_;

  my $http = HTTP::Async-&gt;new;
  my $client = Net::WebSocket::Client-&gt;new(
    url =&gt; "ws://$self-&gt;{host}:$self-&gt;{port}"
  );

  $client-&gt;connect; $client-&gt;send_utf8($prompt);
  my $response = $client-&gt;recv;
  $client-&gt;disconnect;

  return $response;
}

1;</pre><p>With these changes, the class is now called <code>WebService::ChatGPT</code> and can be used like this:</p><pre class="urvanov-syntax-highlighter-plain-tag">use WebService::ChatGPT;

my $chatgpt = WebService::ChatGPT-&gt;new(host =&gt; 'localhost', port =&gt; 8080);

my $response = $chatgpt-&gt;send_prompt('What is your name?');
print "Response: $response\n";</pre><p>This will create a new <code>WebService::ChatGPT</code> object with the specified <code>host</code> and <code>port</code> attributes, and send the text prompt &#8220;What is your name?&#8221; to the ChatGPT server running on localhost at port 8080. The response will be printed to the console.,/p&gt;</p>
<p>Note: This is just one way to rename the <code>ChatGPT</code> class to <code>WebService::ChatGPT</code>. You may also need to update any other references to the class name in your code and documentation, as well as update the module file name and directory structure to reflect the new package name.</p>
<p><em>Suggest some tests using the standard Perl testing framework</em></p>
<p>Here are some examples of tests that you could write for the <code>WebService::ChatGPT</code> module using the standard Perl testing framework (Test::More):</p><pre class="urvanov-syntax-highlighter-plain-tag">use Test::More;
use WebService::ChatGPT;

# Test creating a new ChatGPT object
my $chatgpt = WebService::ChatGPT-&gt;new(host =&gt; 'localhost', port =&gt; 8080);
isa_ok($chatgpt, 'WebService::ChatGPT', 'Object is a ChatGPT');

# Test sending a prompt and receiving a response
my $response = $chatgpt-&gt;send_prompt('What is your name?');
is($response, 'My name is ChatGPT.', 'Response is correct');

# Test sending an invalid prompt
eval { $chatgpt-&gt;send_prompt('') };
like($@, qr/Invalid prompt/, 'Invalid prompt error is thrown');

done_testing();</pre><p>The first test uses the <code>isa_ok</code> function to check that the object created by the <code>new</code> method is an instance of the <code>WebService::ChatGPT</code> class.</p>
<p>The second test uses the <code>is</code> function to compare the expected response to the actual response returned by the <code>send_prompt</code> method.</p>
<p>The third test uses the <code>eval</code> function to catch any exceptions thrown by the <code>send_prompt</code> method when an invalid prompt is provided, and the <code>like</code> function to check that the exception message matches the expected error message.</p>
<p>These tests can be run using the <code>prove</code> command:</p><pre class="urvanov-syntax-highlighter-plain-tag">prove -l t/chatgpt.t</pre><p></p>
<hr />
<p>I haven&#8217;t uploaded it to CPAN yet. Do you think I should?</p>

     <div class="card-body">       <div class="card-text"><p>Hi there!</p>
<p>Yesterday was the 35th birthday of Perl. Congratulation to Larry Wall!</p>
<p>Today is the 1st day of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanukkah">Hanukkah</a>, commemorating the Maccabean revolt agains the Seleucid (Greek) Empire when the Jews recovered Jerusalem roughly 2200 years ago. When I go for my daily stroll, I often pass by some archeological digging from that era. We lit the first candle yesterday night.</p>
<p>In a few days the Christian world will celebrate Christmas, the birth of Yeshua (commonly known as Jesus) roughtly 164 years later. Both events are celebrated by lights and way too much food.</p>
<p>Two weeks ago I wrote extensively about <a href="https://dev.to/">DEV</a> inviting you to post there and even if you don't feel like writing, at least to support the few of us who post about Perl. A few people followed my call. It is still mostly only Yuki Kimoto posting there, but there were a few posts by others, there were some comments and a few "likes". As for me, I publish about a lot of things, not only Perl and I put most of them in series. I have a steady number or readers and the number of followers is also growing nicely. There are more than 400 already. If you too are interested about the subjects I write about <a href="https://dev.to/szabgab/">follow me on DEV</a>.</p>
<p>Enjoy your week!</p>       </div><!-- card-text -->     </div>

    map{ $h{$_} = undef } @digits; 
    return keys %h == @digits; 
}

MAIN:{
    say q// . grep{ is_special($_) } 1 .. $ARGV[0];  
}
</code></pre>

<h3>Sample Run</h3>

<pre><code class="shell">
$ perl perl/ch-1.pl 15
14
$ perl perl/ch-1.pl 35
32
</code></pre>

<h3>Notes</h3>

<p>The definition of a <em>special integer</em> for this problem is an integer whose digits are 
unique. To determine this specialness we define <code>is_special()</code> which splits any given
number into an array of digits. Each of the digits are added to a hash as the keys. If any
digits are not unique then they will not be duplicated as a hash key and the test will 
return false.</p>

<p>Once <code>is_special()</code> is set all we need to do is to map over the given range and count up 
the results! </p>

<h2>Part 2</h2>

<p><em>You are given a list of numbers, @list. Write a script to find most frequent even numbers 
in the list. In case you get more than one even numbers then return the smallest even 
integer. For all other case, return -1.</em></p>

<h3>Solution</h3>

<pre><code class="perl">
use v5.36;
sub most_frequent_even{
    my @list = @_;
    @list = grep { $_ % 2 == 0 } @list; 
    return -1 if @list == 0;  
    my %frequencies;
    map { $frequencies{$_}++ } @list;
    my @sorted = sort { $frequencies{$b} <=> $frequencies{$a} } @list; 
    return $sorted[0] if $frequencies{$sorted[0]} != $frequencies{$sorted[1]};   
    my @tied = grep { $frequencies{$_} == $frequencies{$sorted[0]} } @list;
    return (sort { $a <=> $b } @tied)[0];       
}

MAIN:{
    my @list;
    @list = (1, 1, 2, 6, 2); 
    say most_frequent_even(@list);    
    @list = (1, 3, 5, 7); 
    say most_frequent_even(@list);    
    @list = (6, 4, 4, 6, 1); 
    say most_frequent_even(@list);    
}
</code></pre>

<h3>Sample Run</h3>

<pre><code class="shell">
$ perl perl/ch-2.pl
2
-1
4
</code></pre>

<h3>Notes</h3>

<p>map and grep really do a lot to make this solution pretty succinct. First grep is used to
extract just the even numbers. Then map is used to count up the frequencies. In the case 
of ties grep is used to identify the numbers with a tied frequency. The tied numbers are 
then sorted with the lowest one being returned, as specified.</p>

     <p>Dave writes:</p>

<p>This is my monthly report on work done during November covered by my TPF
perl core maintenance grant.</p>

<p>This month I restarted work in earnest on making the stack reference
counted. I have reached the point where:</p>

<p>Around 250 PP functions have been wrapped - this means that the original
functions will continue to work in the new regime, albeit more slowly.
Each wrapped function can later be individually worked on to remove the
wrapper and regain performance.</p>

<p>The remaining 50 or so PP functions were either so trivial that they
didn't need wrapping, or (for most of them) so complex that they needed to
be hand-crafted to work on both a RC and non-RC stack environment. The
ones needing work included most of the pp_enterfoo() and pp_leavefoo()
functions, along with things like map, grep, sort, goto etc. Fixing these
complex functions is what has mostly been consuming my time.</p>

<p>At the moment these functions don't actually do reference counting: all
the new inline functions which push and pop items off the stack etc
currently skip the RC++ or RC-- bit. But I am nearly at the stage where I
will actually turn on ref-counting, at which point I will have the fun of
fixing all the things I blindly changed which it turns out were wrong.</p>

<p>The Programmer's Credo:</p>

<pre><code> We choose to do these things not because they are easy,
 but because we thought they would be easy.

     <div class="card-body">       <div class="card-text"><p>Hi there,</p>
<p>The <strong>Advent Calendar</strong> celebration begins with the start of <strong>December</strong>. For all <strong>Perl</strong> fans, we have <a href="https://perladvent.org/2022">Perl Advent Calendar 2022</a>, thanks to the hard work of <strong>Olaf Alders</strong> and his team. I am sure you have checked out the amazing daily source of fun.</p>
<p>As of today, we have got through <strong>12 days</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Do you have any favourite so far?</strong></p>
<p>Well I do have mine. To me the best part is the festive flavour in every article. I find it amusing and fun to read the story. I have contributed in the past but never got around to add the spice. I would blame the lack of background knowledge. This year's calendar started with <strong>Toby Inkster</strong> creation <a href="https://perladvent.org/2022/2022-12-01.html">Silent Mite</a>. What a cool way to start the calendar. If you look at closely all the contributions so far, you would notice a fresh air with lots of positive energy. One name stands out very prominently this year is <strong>Thibault DUPONCHELLE</strong>. His first contribution, <a href="https://perladvent.org/2022/2022-12-03.html">Santa is on GitHub</a> was a nice way to begin the journey. Then found a gem from a very dear friend of mine, <strong>Julien Fiegehenn</strong> talking about good old friend <strong>CGI</strong>. In fact, I have seen him presenting the subject <a href="https://perladvent.org/2022/2022-12-04.html">northpole.cgi</a> at the <strong>Perl Conference</strong>. I found another piece of work by <strong>Thibault DUPONCHELLE</strong> about <strong>MongoDB</strong>. I found the <strong>Day 5</strong> contribution <a href="https://perladvent.org/2022/2022-12-05.html">Catching dreams</a> is worth checking, if you want to explore <strong>MongoDB</strong>. If I am not mistaken then few years ago, <strong>Dave Cross</strong> shared his creation <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/SVG::ChristmasTree">SVG::ChristmasTree</a> in <strong>Perl Advent Calendar</strong>. I was happy to see it part of this year calendar too, not directly though. <strong>Day 8</strong> started with <a href="https://perladvent.org/2022/2022-12-08.html">A Perlmas Tree</a> by <strong>Maximilian Lika</strong>. I found <strong>Day 11</strong> contribution very technical dealing with <strong>signal ALRM</strong>. Not an easy subject to discuss in the <strong>Advent Calendar</strong> in my humble opinion. Thanks <strong>OODLER</strong> for the fine contribution, <a href="https://perladvent.org/2022/2022-12-11.html">Wake up! Time to open presents!</a>.</p>
<p>If you are still looking for more <strong>Advent Calendar</strong> theme fun then I would highly recommend, <a href="https://theweeklychallenge.org/blog/advent-calendar-2022">The Weekly Challenge Advent Calendar</a>. Like in the past, this year also, it has contributions from <strong>Team PWC</strong> hand picked by me. I am sure you would find it interesting.</p>
<p>I am working on something that I would love to be part of this year <strong>Perl Advent Calendar</strong>. Hopefully it would be ready soon. Well I am also working on something similar for <strong>Raku Advent Calendar</strong>. It would be an achievement if I can get both done on time. Please wish me luck.</p>

     <div class="card-body">       <div class="card-text"><p>Hi there!</p>
<p>I registered to <a href="https://dev.to/">DEV.to</a> in 2017, more than 5 years ago. Posted a few articles with rather limited success: less than 10 people looked at the articles. Then in 2020 I posted a few more articles. On one of them <a href="https://dev.to/szabgab/tests-are-awesome-3i63">Tests are awesome!</a> I got as many as 300 readers, but the others have not received much love so I did not continue publishing. In 2021 I had another experiment when I published <a href="https://dev.to/szabgab/perl-modules-with-their-own-web-site-2gmo">Perl modules with their own web site</a> on which there were some 600 visitors. Primarily the readers of the Perl Weekly newsletter. I published a few more articles with readers in the low 10s. A few weeks ago I started to publish again. This time several of my articles got above 100 viewers and one, <a href="https://dev.to/szabgab/open-source-development-courses-5d4b">Open Source Development Courses</a> is already above 1100 viewers. I started to get around 600 readers a day. That's already really valuable!</p>
<p>So what happened? There were a couple of changes: 1. There are more people on DEV. 2. I publish a lot more articles that appeal to a wider range of people. 3. There is a sort-of network effect. The more people up-vote and bookmark (the two kinds of reactions on DEV) my articles the more people will see it.</p>
<p>The nice thing about DEV is that I can republish the articles I published elsewhere (e.g. on <a href="https://perlmaven.com/">PerlMaven</a>, on <a href="https://code-maven.com/">Code-Maven</a>, or <a href="https://blogs.perl.org/">blogs.perl.org</a>), and also I can set the canonical URL of each article on DEV to the original one on my blog. That way I get the visitors on DEV as well, but the 'Google juice' the articles receive will flow over to my sites. It seems like a win-win for DEV and authors who have blogs elsewhere. You can even configure DEV to pull your RSS feed and create drafts from your articles published elsewhere. I even started to republish the content of the <a href="https://dev.to/szabgab/perl-weekly-591-less-than-50-use-ci-4966">Perl Weekly</a>.</p>
<p>So here is what I suggest. If you already write about Perl elsewhere, republish those articles on DEV and tag them with <b>perl</b>. If you are primarily a reader of articles, then register on <a href="https://dev.to/">DEV</a> and start up-voting the <a href="https://dev.to/t/perl">Perl-related posts</a> you like. You can even follow a few authors there, get notified when they have new posts, and up-vote those to encourage them to write even more.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can watch the <a href="https://perl.theplanetarium.org/">Perl Planetarium</a>. It already follows the <b>perl</b> tag on DEV.</p>
<p>Enjoy your week!</p>       </div><!-- card-text -->     </div>

<p><em>The examples used here are from the weekly challenge problem statement and demonstrate 
the working solution.</em></p>

<h2>Part 1</h2>

<p><em>You are given an integer, $n > 0. Write a script to find all possible binary numbers of 
size $n.</em></p>

<h3>Solution</h3>

<pre><code class="perl">
use v5.36;
sub binary_numbers_size_n{
    my($n) = @_;
    my @numbers = map {
        sprintf("%0${n}b", $_)
    } 0 .. 2**$n - 1;
    return @numbers;
}

MAIN:{
    say join(", ", binary_numbers_size_n(2));
    say join(", ", binary_numbers_size_n(3));
    say join(", ", binary_numbers_size_n(4));
}
</code></pre>

<h3>Sample Run</h3>

<pre><code class="shell">
$ perl perl/ch-1.pl
00, 01, 10, 11
000, 001, 010, 011, 100, 101, 110, 111
0000, 0001, 0010, 0011, 0100, 0101, 0110, 0111, 1000, 1001, 1010, 1011, 1100, 1101, 1110, 1111
</code></pre>

<h3>Notes</h3>

<p>I think it's fair to say that <code>sprintf</code> is doing most of the work here! For those 
unfamiliar, the format string <code>"%0${n}b"</code> means <em>print the number as binary of length $n,
left pad with 0s</em>.  </p>

<h2>Part 2</h2>

<p><em>You are given a list of strings of same length, @s. Write a script to find the odd string 
in the given list. Use positional alphabet values starting 
with 0, i.e. a = 0, b = 1, ... z = 25.</em></p>

<h3>Solution</h3>

<pre><code class="perl">
use v5.36;
sub odd_string{
    my(@strings) = @_;
    my %differences;
    for my $string (@strings){
        my $current;
        my $previous;
        my @differences;
        map {
            unless($previous){
                $previous = $_;
            }
            else{
                $current = $_;
                push @differences, ord($current) - ord($previous);
                $previous = $current;
            }        
        } split(//, $string);
        my $key = join(",", @differences);
        my $size_before = keys %differences;
        $differences{$key} = undef;
        my $size_after = keys %differences;
        return $string if $size_before > 0 && $size_after - $size_before == 1;
    }
    return undef;
}

MAIN:{
    say odd_string(qw/adc wzy abc/);
    say odd_string(qw/aaa bob ccc ddd/);
    say odd_string(qw/aaaa bbbb cccc dddd/) || "no odd string found";
    say odd_string(qw/aaaa bbob cccc dddd/);
}
</code></pre>

<h3>Sample Run</h3>

<pre><code class="shell">
$ perl perl/ch-2.pl
abc
bob
no odd string found
bbob
</code></pre>

<h3>Notes</h3>

<p>There is one main assumption here and that is that the list of strings is going to be of
length three or more. If the array has length one then can we say that single string is 
"odd" in and of itself? And if we have only two strings and they aren't the same which is 
the the odd one?</p>

<p>The basic steps of this solution are:</p>

<p>1) For each string split it into an array of characters.</p>

<p>2) Compute the differences. This is done in the <code>map</code>. I'll concede that this is a 
somewhat unusual use of <code>map</code>!</p>

<p>3) Transform the differences into a single string to be used as a hash key using <code>join</code>.</p>

<p>4) If we add this differences based key to the hash and the hash size changes by 
1 (assuming it is a non-empty hash) then we know we have found the unique "odd string" 
which is then returned.</p>
