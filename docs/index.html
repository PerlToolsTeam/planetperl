<p><a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/advanced-perl-programming/1565922204/">Advanced Perl Programming</a> is a book from <strong>Sriram Srinivasan</strong> published in 1997 (ouch!).</p>

<p>It's old, if you're a Perl <em>newcomer</em>, don't read such old books (in addition that this book is not adapted to your level).</p>

<p>There is a <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/advanced-perl-programming/0596004567/">second edition</a> of this book but it seems a totally different book (different author). Also the <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/advanced-perl-programming/9781484258637/">Advanced Perl Programming: From Advanced to Expert</a> from <strong>William Bo Rothwell</strong> seems a completely different book.</p>

<p><strong>Advanced Perl Programming</strong> is old but interesting... but I have to admit that it is no consistent in quality.</p>

<p>I think this book is for "hardcore Perl programmers" 😀</p>

<h2>
  <a href="#start-of-the-book">
  </a>
  Start of the book
</h2>

<p>The first chapters talk about Perl internals from a Perl developer point of view: references, symbolic refs, reference counting, symbol table, anonymous subs and closures. </p>

<p>It continues with advanced Perl topics (eval and modules).</p>

<p>These chapters give an overall feeling of cleanliness and deep research from author. Each notion is compared to other programming languages (Java, C++, Tcl) which is VERY interesting. In short I loved these chapters.</p>

<p>It makes me think the author is a senior developer and has made a nice research work :)</p>

<h2>
  <a href="#middle-of-the-book">
  </a>
  Middle of the book
</h2>

<p>I really less appreciated this part, it's about Object Oriented Programming, interfaces, persistence, templating... But if topics seem cool, it has flaws, it's based often on big pieces of imaginary code (not on CPAN) and/or old technologies. I can't say it's bad, but I definitely less enjoyed this part because also the style. Overall I think it's harder to follow because the ordering where code snippets are introduced is rough (e.g. The tetris chapter). </p>

<p>There are still interesting things to pick up in the middle of this, e.g. I enjoyed the chapter about "Tie" (chapter 9) and Persistence (chapter 10).</p>

<h2>
  <a href="#end-of-the-book">
  </a>
  End of the book
</h2>

<p>Starting chapter 18, we are back to Perl internals (perl <em>interpreter</em> internals this time). Personally I'm interested in this and I found this part really great. </p>

     <div class="card-body">       <div class="card-text"><p>Hi there</p>
<p>Welcome to my first edition of 2022 and <strong>95th edition</strong> overall.</p>
<p>I remember there was a time when the <strong>O'Reilly</strong> group published many Perl books. Then came a few other publishing houses like <strong>Manning</strong> publications. I am sure you must have owned a handful of Perl books from these publishers. In recent times not many Perl books have been written, except one or two by <strong>brian d foy</strong>. A friend of mine donated all his Perl books to a local library as he is moving to Python. It is a sad state to be honest. Recently, I came across a <strong>Facebook</strong> post by a friend of mine about a Perl book called <strong>Extending and Embedding Perl</strong>. I knew about it but I had never had the chance to read it. So I decided to buy a used copy from <strong>Amazon</strong>. I must confess I was missing a great deal. If you haven't read it then you must check it out. By the way, I have kept all my Perl books safe. I like to read physical books and not online versions.</p>
<p>With a new year, there is a tradition of new year resolutions. As far as I am concerned, I stopped making any resolutions two years ago. But this year, I decided to make one and stick to it. And the resolution is to get the draft of my first Perl book out as soon as possible. It has been going on for months now. It is embarassing now to even talk about it. There are so many things going on at the same time, I hardly find time for the book. Please wish me luck.</p>
<p>A long time ago, <strong>Gabor</strong> started a campaign to make live videos about Perl. He even did few pair-programming sessions and they were very popular. But then there has been no noise on that front in recent times. I used to make <strong>YouTube</strong> videos for the Weekly Challenge during the middle of last year and then I also stopped because of lack of time. Last month, I started making videos again for the Weekly Challenge. It gives me immense pleasure when I see comments on my videos. Someone recently commented on one video and requested I should make videos of past challenges as well. I have to manage my time carefully otherwise my first book would be neglected again. Having said that, I am not giving up on making videos for the Weekly Challenge. If you are interested then please do check out my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/mohammadsajidanwar">YouTube Channel</a>.</p>
<p>There is one piece of good news shared by <strong>Curtis</strong> - that the MMVP (minimally minimal viable product) RFC for Corinna has been sent to P5P. I am keeping my fingers crossed.</p>
<p>Last but not least, please look after yourself and your loved ones.</p>       </div><!-- card-text -->     </div>

        <p>In which we leap tall primes in a single bound, mis-take a tree, test percussion, and find the limits of a Curious Module.</p>

<p>Task 1: 10001st Prime Number - One-liners (expanded) in Raku and Perl.</p>

<p>Task 2: Curious Fraction Tree - Solutions in Raku and Perl (with 200+ tests), and another Perl solution using a CPAN module.</p>

        <h1><a href="https://theweeklychallenge.org/blog/perl-weekly-challenge-146/#TASK1">TWC Task #1, 10001st Prime Number</a></h1>

<h2>Perl</h2>

<p>My <a href="https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-146/bruce-gray/perl/ch-1.pl">Perl program</a> is a 3-line version of this one-liner:</p>

<pre><code>perl -Mntheory=nth_prime -wE 'say nth_prime(10_001)'
</code></pre>

<p>The <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/ntheory">ntheory</a> (Number Theory) module has many routines that would solve the problem. <code>nth_prime</code> is the most direct.</p>

<h2>Raku</h2>

<pre><code>constant @primes = (2, 3, 5, 7 ... *).grep(&amp;is-prime);
say @primes.skip(10_000).head;
</code></pre>

<p>That <a href="https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-146/bruce-gray/raku/ch-1.raku">first line</a> creates a "constant" lazy infinte array of primes. It is constant in the sense that the program code cannot alter a value, but it is lazy, so the elements of <code>@primes[0..N]</code> are not generated until something tries to use <code>@primes[N]</code>. All the prior elements are cached and delivered on request without recalculation. If a higher element is requested later in the program's execution, then the generation of <code>@primes</code> elements will resume where it left off.</p>

<h1><a href="https://theweeklychallenge.org/blog/perl-weekly-challenge-146/#TASK2">TWC Task #2, Curious Fraction Tree</a></h1>

<p>I studied the patterns of parent->children and child->parent, slung some code to solve the task, wrote more to extend the tree, and searched <a href="https://oeis.org/">OEIS</a> and the Web.</p>

<h2>Observations:</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>The "Curious Fraction Tree" is properly named the "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calkin%E2%80%93Wilf_tree">Calkin-Wilf Tree</a>", but is easily confused with the 150+year-earlier "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stern%E2%80%93Brocot_tree">Stern-Brocot tree</a>". <br />
(by "easily confused", I mean that I confused them. Also confused C-W with Kepler's tree of harmonic fractions.)</p></li>
<li><p>Coolest illustration of the C-W tree: <a href="https://www.jasondavies.com/calkin-wilf-tree/">https://www.jasondavies.com/calkin-wilf-tree/</a></p></li>
<li><p>C-W tree covers every rational number. <br />
(Infinite in two dimensions? No big deal, I can do that easily via diagonals; we just get lots of duplicates.)</p>

<ul>
<li>C-W tree does not need diagonals, and <em>never</em> has duplicates. <br />
<ul>
<li>...I can't do that.
<ul>
<li>Apparently, I can't even understand the proof!</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Raku has rational numbers as a built-in type: <a href="https://docs.raku.org/type/Rat">Rat</a>. Rat is auto-normalizing (3/6 becomes 1/2), has .numerator and .denominator methods, and a .nude method to get a list of both (Nu/De) at once.</p></li>
<li><p>If you follow a fraction's C-W lineage all the way back to (but not including) the 1/1 root, reverse that lineage to be root-to-descendant, and map each fraction along-the-way as proper-fraction==L, improper-fraction==R (i.e. more than 1 or less than 1), then you get a navigation tree of which branch to follow, all the way to the original number. e.g. 8/19 has the navigation of RLRRLL.</p>

<ul>
<li>To a percussionist, those navigations look just like snare drum rudiments and exercises: 'RLRRLL' is a <a href="https://www.drumlessons.com/drum-lessons/drum-set-rudiments/single-paradiddle-diddle/">single paradiddle-diddle</a>
<ul>
<li>Those navigations can translate back-and-forth (if we are careful) to binary numbers, and so to plain decimal integers. (More on this when I discover the Curious Module below.)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Exploring the tree via regular patterns of L(s) and R(s) finds some interesting properties:</p>

<ul>
<li>'LLLLLL'... and 'RRRRRR'... are the left and right edges of the tree, with top or bottom == 1. <br />
1/101    # 'L' x 100 <br />
101/1    # 'R' x 100</li>
<li>R,'LLLLLL'... and L,'RRRRRR'... are the two center-most numbers ("framing" the half-way point) on any level after the first. Top or bottom will be '2'.</li>
<li>LR,'LLLLLL'... and LL,'RRRRRR'... frame the quarter-way point; <br />
RR,'LLLLLL'... and RL,'RRRRRR'... frame the three-quarter-way point on any level after the second. Top or bottom will be '3'.</li>
<li>(and so on, for row divisions by 8, 16, 32, ...)</li>
<li>Single-bit set (or unset) produce the top (or bottom) sequence 2,3,4...(size+1) as we slide the position of the bit: <br />
2/31   # RLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL <br />
3/44   # LRLLLLLLLLLLLLLL <br />
4/55   # LLRLLLLLLLLLLLLL <br />
... <br />
31/2   # LRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR <br />
44/3   # RLRRRRRRRRRRRRRR <br />
55/4   # RRLRRRRRRRRRRRRR</li>
<li>Alternating L and R reaches the 1/3-point and 2/3-point in a row, producing approximations of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_ratio">Golden Ratio</a> φ ("The most irrational number"; 1.618033988749...), and its inverse|conjugate. <br />
These numbers are all ratios of successive Fibonacci numbers. <br />
e.g.  LRLRLRLRLRLRLRLRLRL => 6765/10946 == F(20)/F(21) == 0.618034</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>After satisfying my urge for percussive exploration, I formalized the findings into a <a href="https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-146/bruce-gray/Test_data/ch-2_tests.txt">file of tests</a> that the Perl and Raku solutions could both access, then wrote <a href="https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-146/bruce-gray/Test_data/ch-2_test_generator.raku">utility routines</a> to help anyone who wants to explore more deeply.</p>

<p>I later found mention in a paper (URL?) that, unlike the Stern-Brocot tree, the C-W tree can be navigated directly <em>across</em> a row, also moving from the end of one row to the start of the next row. I added the calculation to the utility routines as `<a href="https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-146/bruce-gray/Test_data/ch-2_test_generator.raku#L16">next-Calkin-Wilf-neighbor</a>.</p>

<p>After <em>all</em> <em>that</em>, I found a Perl module on CPAN that solves the problem: <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Math::PlanePath::RationalsTree#Calkin-Wilf-Tree">Math::PlanePath::RationalsTree</a>.
This lead to a proof-of-concept one-liner, that calculates the parent but not the grandparent:</p>

<pre><code>perl -MMath::PlanePath::RationalsTree -wE 'my $CW = Math::PlanePath::RationalsTree-&gt;new( tree_type =&gt; "CW" ); say join "/", $CW-&gt;n_to_xy( $CW-&gt;tree_n_parent( $CW-&gt;xy_to_n(@ARGV) ) );' 4817 5410
</code></pre>

<p>I cloned my original Perl solution and replaced my algorithm with calls to the module, as <a href="https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-146/bruce-gray/perl/ch-2_via_module.pl">ch-2<em>via</em>module.pl</a>, so I could be sure that the module could play in my drumming circle.</p>

<p>It worked perfectly, except where it didn't. Of 202 tests, only 166 passed.</p>

<p>Looking deeper into the 36 test failures, the problem became obvious. The module handles all types of rational trees with the efficient method of translating the LR navigation into zeros and ones to make (when decoded from binary) an integer. That integer represents the linear position of the rational.</p>

<pre><code>$ perl -MMath::PlanePath::RationalsTree -wE 'my $CW = Math::PlanePath::RationalsTree-&gt;new( tree_type =&gt; "CW" ); say "N=$_ : tree_element=", join "/", $CW-&gt;n_to_xy( $_ ) for 1..5;'
N=1 : tree_element=1/1
N=2 : tree_element=1/2
N=3 : tree_element=2/1
N=4 : tree_element=1/3
N=5 : tree_element=3/2
</code></pre>

<p>The tree gets <em>twice</em> as big for every row (level?) you go down. Exponential growth! Around row 64, N will be around 2^64, and overflow the integer size of 64-bit Perl. All the tests below N=2^64 passed, as did some beyond that point (vagaries of rounding?), but you cannot rely on accuracy past that point. E.g.: finding the parent of "1/65" gives the wrong answer using the "convert to N" method, while 1/10001 and beyond all work with the direct calculations in Perl and Raku. (To be fair, Raku starts having problems past level 90 when drilling down along the Golden Ratio, due to <a href="https://docs.raku.org/type/Rat">Rat</a> auto-collapsing into a more efficient <a href="https://docs.raku.org/type/Num">Num</a>. This could be prevented by using FatRat.)</p>

<h2>Raku</h2>

<p>Of note in my <a href="https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-146/bruce-gray/raku/ch-2.raku">Raku solution</a> :</p>

<ul>
<li>Clean separation of types: Calkin-Wilf-tree-parent() takes and returns Rat, and task2() takes and returns Str.</li>
<li>Symmetry: task2() splits on slash at the start, and joins on slash at the end.</li>
<li>Sequence: @lineage is a lazy <a href="https://docs.raku.org/type/Seq">Seq</a> going all the way back to the root, generated by repeated calls to get the parent of the last result. This "keep feeding the result back in as the next argument" (iterated function) is a common-enough pattern that Raku directly supports it via the <a href="https://docs.raku.org/routine/....html"><code>...</code> or "sequence" operator</a>. Since the Seq is lazy, and we only ask for the first two ancestors (via .head), only two are calculated.</li>
<li>Contain to Name: Placing the difference in its own variable allows not only DRY in the return statement, but also the symmetry between the two possible results. I particularly like how <code>diff</code> and <code>-diff</code> read, compared to <code>n-d</code> and d-n. (If I had not already committed, I might change <code>diff/d</code> to <code>+diff/d</code> to call attention the sign change).</li>
<li>multi sub MAIN clearly shows the two ways to run the program.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Perl</h2>

<p>Of note in my <a href="https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-146/bruce-gray/perl/ch-2.pl">Perl solution</a> :</p>

<ul>
<li>Clean separation of types: Calkin<em>Wilf</em>tree_parent() takes and returns a two-element [numerator,denominator] arrayref, and task2() takes and returns a "numerator/denominator" string.</li>
<li>map==grep++ : <code>map</code> is also serving as <code>grep</code> via the empty-list trick; if no non-whitespace characters exist in the line, then <code>map</code> produces <em>nothing</em> for that line, not even <code>undef</code>; the line is skipped.</li>
<li>/r : Using the <code>r</code> modifier (part of s{...}{...}msxr) on the substitution lets me return a changed copy, instead of modifying the original.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Spoiler Alert:</em> This weekly challenge deadline is due in a few days from now (on January 9, 2022 at 24:00). This blog post offers some solutions to this challenge, please don’t read on if you intend to complete the challenge on your own.</p>

<h2>Task 1: 10001st Prime Number</h2>

<p><em>Write a script to generate the 10001st prime number.</em></p>

<h3>10001st Prime Number in Raku</h3>

<p>Raku has a fast <a href="https://docs.raku.org/routine/is-prime">is-prime</a> subroutine or method, using the Miller-Rabin algorithm, to test whether a integer is prime. We can just generate an infinite (lazy) list of prime numbers and look for the 10000st one.</p>

<pre><code>use v6;

my @primes = grep { .is-prime }, (1, 2, 3, -&gt; $a { $a + 2} ...Inf);
say @primes[10001 - 1];  # Subtract 1 because the array starts at 0
</code></pre>

<p>This script displays the following output:</p>

<pre><code>$ raku ./10001prime.raku
104743
</code></pre>

<p>The Raku script is so simple that it can be implemented as a short Raku one-liner:</p>

<pre><code>$ ./raku -e 'say (grep { .is-prime }, 1..Inf)[10000]'
104743
</code></pre>

<h3>10001st Prime Number in Perl</h3>

<p>Since Perl doesn&#8217;t have a built-in <code>is-prime</code> subroutine, we implement our own. As finding the first 10001 primes is an intensive computation, we implement three performance optimizations compared to the naive brute-force solution: first, with the exception of 2, we only check odd integers. Second, we limit the tested divisors to the square root of the integer being checked. Finally, rather than testing all possible divisors, we test only the primes that we have already found. With these three optimizations, the script runs in less than 0.2 second, much faster than I expected.</p>

<pre><code>use strict;
use warnings;
use feature "say";
use constant MAX =&gt; 10_001;

sub primes {
    my $max = shift;
    my @primes = (2, 3, 5);
    my $count = 3;
    my $candidate = $primes[-1];
    while ($count &lt;= $max) {
        $candidate += 2;
        my $not_prime = 0;
        my $sq_cand = sqrt $candidate;
        for my $i (@primes) {
            $not_prime = 1, last unless $candidate % $i;
            last if $i &gt; $sq_cand;
        }
        next if $not_prime;
        push @primes, $candidate;
        $count ++;
    }
    return $primes[$max-1];
}
my $p = primes(MAX);
say "$p";
</code></pre>

<p>This script displays the following output:</p>

<pre><code>$ time perl ./10001prime.pl
104743

real    0m0,192s
user    0m0,124s
sys     0m0,077s
</code></pre>

<h3>10001st Prime Number in Ring</h3>

<p>I continue my exploration of <em>Ring</em>, a recent programming language (the first version was issued in 2016). The Ring implementation below is essentially a port of the Perl program above (with same performance optimizations):</p>

<pre><code>p = primes(10001)
see p + nl

func primes max
    primes = [2, 3, 5]
    count = len(primes)
    candidate = primes[count]
    while count &lt; max
        candidate += 2
        is_prime = True
        sqrt_cand = sqrt(candidate)
        for i in primes
            if candidate % i = 0
                is_prime = False
                exit
            ok
            if i &gt; sqrt_cand exit ok
        next
        if is_prime 
            add(primes, candidate)
            count ++
        ok
    end
    return primes[max]
</code></pre>

<p>This program displays the following output:</p>

<pre><code>$ ring ./10001prime.ring
104743
</code></pre>

<p>Note that Ring lists start with subscript 1, so we use index 10001 for finding the 10001 ptime number.</p>

<h3>10001st Prime Number in Julia</h3>

<pre><code>function getprimes(max)
    primes = [2, 3, 5]
    count = 3
    candidate = 5
    while (count &lt;= max)
        candidate += 2
        not_prime = false
        sq_cand = sqrt(candidate)
        for i in primes
            if (candidate % i == 0)
                not_prime = true
                break
            end
            i &gt; max &amp;&amp; break
        end
        not_prime &amp;&amp; continue
        push!(primes, candidate)
        count += 1
    end
    return primes[max] # Julia arrays start with index 1
end

p = getprimes(10001)
println(p)
</code></pre>

<p>This program displays the following output:</p>

<pre><code>$ julia 10001prime.jl
104743
</code></pre>

<h2>Task 2: Curious Fraction Tree</h2>

<p><em>Consider the following Curious Fraction Tree:</em></p>

<p><img alt="curious_fraction_146.png" src="http://blogs.perl.org/users/laurent_r/curious_fraction_146.png" width="533" height="305" class="mt-image-none" style="" /></p>

<p><em>You are given a fraction, member of the tree created similar to the above sample.</em></p>

<p><em>Write a script to find out the parent and grandparent of the given member.</em></p>

<p><em>Example 1:</em></p>

<pre><code>Input: $member = '3/5';
Output: parent = '3/2' and grandparent = '1/2'
</code></pre>

<p><em>Example 2:</em></p>

<pre><code>Input: $member = '4/3';
Output: parent = '1/3' and grandparent = '1/2'
</code></pre>

<p>The first problem is to understand how this tree is constructed.</p>

<p>Each fraction has two children. It is easy to see that the left child is always a number smaller than 1 and the right child is always a number larger than 1. But how are the values generated?</p>

<p>Well, it is probably not so difficult to find out, but I must confess that I did not try very hard to find the constructing rules, but found them on <a href="https://gdaymath.com/lessons/fractions/5-3-a-curious-fraction-tree/">the Curious Fraction Tree Web page</a>. They are explained in this diagram:</p>

<p><img alt="curious_fraction_tree_pwc146.png" src="http://blogs.perl.org/users/laurent_r/curious_fraction_tree_pwc146.png" width="287" height="224" class="mt-image-none" style="" /></p>

<p>In other words, we have the following rules:</p>

<ul>
<li>For any node, the left child is less than 1 et the right child larger than 1;</li>
<li>For node <code>a/b</code>, left child is <code>a/(a+b)</code> and right node is <code>(a+b)/b</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>From these two rules, it is easy to derive the reciprocal rules for finding the parent of a node:</p>

<ul>
<li>For a node <code>x/y</code> with a fraction less than 1, the parent is <code>x/(y-x)</code>;</li>
<li>For a node <code>x/y</code> with a fraction larger than 1, the parent is <code>(x-y)/x</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>It is now very easy to implement these rules in various programming languages.</p>

<p>There is, however, one little last problem. The task specifications do not tell us what to do about invalid input. For example, if the input is <code>(1, 1)</code> (the root to the tree), we will not be able to find a parent. Similarly, if we are given <code>(1/2)</code> as input, we will find <code>(1, 1)</code> as the parent, and will not be able to the grand-parent. We would have a problem if one of the values is 0. It is fairly easy to detect these problems, but I still wouldn&#8217;t know what to do about it. In many of the implementations below, I have decided that we must be given a valid input and will not try to validate the input. In some others, I have decided to detect some of these invalid input problems and tried to do something reasonable about them.</p>

<h3>Curious Fraction Tree in Raku</h3>

<p>We&#8217;re just implementing the rules above. Here, I do not try to validate the input.</p>

<p>Note that I was first tempted to implement the fraction as a <code>Rat</code> type of value, since it implements it as a numerator/denominator pair. I finally decided not to do that (because there may be some cases where the fraction might be reduced to their simplest form, division by 0 errors, and other such problems). So I decided to implement the fractions as integer pairs.</p>

<pre><code>use v6;

# for a node x/y less than 1, parent is x/(y-x)
# for a node x/y larger than 1, parent is (x-y)/x

sub parent (\num, \denom) {
    return num &lt; denom ?? (num, denom - num) !! (num - denom, denom);
}
for (5, 2), (2, 5), (3, 4), (3, 5) -&gt; $fraction {
    my $parent = parent |$fraction[0,1];
    my $gd-parent = parent |$parent[0,1];
    say "for child $fraction, parent is $parent and gd-parent is $gd-parent"; 
}
</code></pre>

<p>With the test fractions provided in the code, this program displays the following output:</p>

<pre><code>raku ./fraction-tree.raku
for child 5 2, parent is 3 2 and gd-parent is 1 2
for child 2 5, parent is 2 3 and gd-parent is 2 1
for child 3 4, parent is 3 1 and gd-parent is 2 1
for child 3 5, parent is 3 2 and gd-parent is 1 2
</code></pre>

<h3>Curious Fraction Tree in Perl</h3>

<p>This program implements the rules described above. Here, we have made some effort to validate the input, just as an example: we write an error value if we get pas the root node.</p>

<pre><code>use strict;
use warnings;
use feature "say";

# for a node x/y less than 1, parent is x/(y-x)
# for a node x/y larger than 1, parent is (x-y)/x

sub parent {
    my ($num, $denom) = @{$_[0]};
    return ["Error"] if $num == $denom;
    return $num &lt; $denom ? [$num, $denom - $num] : [$num - $denom, $denom];
}

for my $fraction ([5, 2], [2, 5], [3, 4], [3, 5], [2, 1], [1, 1]) {
    die "Invalid input node @$fraction" if $$fraction[0] == $$fraction[1];
    my $parent = parent $fraction;
    my $gd_parent = parent $parent;
    say "for child @$fraction, parent is @$parent and gd-parent is @$gd_parent"; 
}
</code></pre>

<p>This program displays the following output:</p>

<pre><code>$ perl ./fraction-tree.pl
for child 5 2, parent is 3 2 and gd-parent is 1 2
for child 2 5, parent is 2 3 and gd-parent is 2 1
for child 3 4, parent is 3 1 and gd-parent is 2 1
for child 3 5, parent is 3 2 and gd-parent is 1 2
for child 2 1, parent is 1 1 and gd-parent is Error
Invalid input node 1 1 at fraction-tree.pl line 15.
</code></pre>

<h3>Curious Fraction Tree in Some Other Programming Languages</h3>

<h4>In Ring</h4>

<p>Again the same rules as before, with an attempt to handle gracefully some of the exceptions:</p>

<pre><code># for a node x/y less than 1, parent is x/(y-x)
# for a node x/y larger than 1, parent is (x-y)/x

for test in [ [5, 2], [2, 5], [3, 4], [3,5], [6, 2], [1, 2] ]
    parent = find_parent(test[1], test[2])
    gd_parent = find_parent(parent[1], parent[2])
    see "Node " + to_str(test) + " has parent " + to_str(parent) + 
        " and grand-parent " + to_str(gd_parent) + nl
next

func find_parent num, denom
    if num &lt; denom
        return [num, denom - num]
    but denom &lt; num
        return [num - denom, denom]
    else 
        return ["Error", ""]
    ok

func to_str input
    return "" + input[1] + " " + input[2]
</code></pre>

<p>This script displays the following output:</p>

<pre><code>$ ring ./fraction-tree.ring
Node 5 2 has parent 3 2 and grand-parent 1 2
Node 2 5 has parent 2 3 and grand-parent 2 1
Node 3 4 has parent 3 1 and grand-parent 2 1
Node 3 5 has parent 3 2 and grand-parent 1 2
Node 6 2 has parent 4 2 and grand-parent 2 2
Node 1 2 has parent 1 1 and grand-parent Error

<h4>In Python</h4>

<p>No attempt here to validate the input.</p>

    parent = find_parent(test[0], test[1])
    gd_parent = find_parent(parent[0], parent[1])
    print("Node", test, "has parent", parent, "and grand-parent", gd_parent)
</code></pre>

<p>Output:</p>

end

for test in [ [5, 2], [2, 5], [3, 4], [3, 5], [1, 2] ]
    parent = find_parent(test[1], test[2])
    gd_parent = find_parent(parent[1], parent[2])
    println("Node $test has parent $parent and grand-parent $gd_parent")

                <h2>The Weekly Challenge 145</h2>

        <p>The <a href="https://theweeklychallenge.org/blog/perl-weekly-challenge-145/#TASK2">Task 2 of the Weekly Challenge #145</a> asked us to build a Palindromic Tree. It also linked to a <a href="https://medium.com/@alessiopiergiacomi/eertree-or-palindromic-tree-82453e75025b">blog post</a> explaining the "Eertree" data structure.</p>

        <p>Maybe it was just me, but I found the blog post confusing. Fortunately, it further linked to a <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.04862.pdf">scientific paper</a> that introduced the structure around 2014.</p>

                <p>I spent several evenings of the Christmas holidays wrapping my head around the description of the algorithm to efficiently build the graph. Most of it is described in the proof of Proposition 2, but some parts are rather laconic. I wasn’t able to implement the creation of a suffix link from <code>P</code> where <code>|P| &gt; 1</code>. The article says:</p>

        <blockquote><i>&hellip;just continue traversing suffix-palindromes of <code>T</code> starting with the suffix link of <code>Q</code>.</i></blockquote>

        <p>My implementation passed all the test cases from the Challenge, but I was able to find counter examples (e.g. the string “xabcxc”) for which the implementation didn’t work correctly. I clearly had no idea what “continue traversing” meant, even though I had implemented the traversing up to the moment correctly.</p>

        <p>In the end, I noticed the blog post had a reply (kind of hidden in the UI) which (when clicked to reveal the full text) showed a link to a <a href="https://github.com/shubham2508/custom_datastructures/blob/master/palindromic_tree.py">Python implementation</a>. From that I was able to understand the logic and finish my implementation.</p>

        <h2>Rosetta Code</h2>

        <p>Once finished, I checked fellow challengers’ solutions. To my surprise, someone just copied the solution from <a href="https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Eertree#Perl">Rosetta Code</a>:</p>

        <pre><code>for $n (1 .. length($str)) {
   for $m (1 .. length($str)) {
      $strrev = "";
      $strpal = substr($str, $n-1, $m);
      if ($strpal ne "") {
         for $p (reverse 1 .. length($strpal)) {
            $strrev .= substr($strpal, $p-1, 1);
         }
         ($strpal eq $strrev) and push @pal, $strpal;
      }
   }
}
 
print join ' ', grep {not $seen{$_}++} @pal, "\n";</code></pre>

      <p>My solution had about 100 lines. I’d spent hours working on it, to only discover this short and easy implementation!</p>

      <p>“Wait,” thought I to myself, “this is cheating. The Rosetta Code solution just lists all the palindromes, it doesn’t really construct the structure. And the structure was interesting because it was efficient. Maybe my solution is at least faster when it’s not shorter.”</p>

      <p>And that’s actually true. For longer strings (more than 12 characters) my solution starts beating the Rosetta Code one, and for 25 characters it’s already 3.5&times; faster.</p>

      <p>You can find my solution on <a href="https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-145/e-choroba/perl/ch-2.pl">GitHub</a>. As there’s no Eertree module on CPAN (at least the search doesn’t return anything) I might end up uploading it there, but it needs some polishing before it’s ready.</p>

<h3>Notes</h3>

<p>I've mentioned it before, but for anything that asks for or needs prime numbers I always
ust grab them from one of several convenient online sources, rather than generate them 
myself.</p>

<p>This time around I figured it'd be sporting to generate them myself, but maybe in an
interesting way. Here I implement a sieve method for determining prime numbers. This
<em>Sieve of Atkin</em>_ has a claim to fame of being the most performant among prime number
generating sieve techniques. The code is a bit convoluted looking, I will admit, but is 
a faithful Perl representation of the algorithm (follow the reference link for 
pseudocode). Also, rather than try and explain the algorithm myself anyone interested
can find full in depth treatments elsewhere. A background in number theory helps for 
some of the details.</p>

<p>Since I have some existing code for getting the pre-computed primes I figured I would
use that as a check and extra feature. Command line options allow for the default
behavior (fetch pre-computed primes for an N of 10,001) to be overridden.</p>

<h2>Part 2</h2>

<p><em>Given a fraction return the parent and grandparent of the fraction from the Curious 
Fraction Tree.</em></p>

<h3>Solution</h3>

<pre><code class="perl">
use strict;
use warnings;

use Graph;
use constant ROOT => "1/1";
use constant SEPARATOR => "/";

    my($member) = @_;
    my $graph = new Graph();
    $graph->add_vertex(ROOT);
    my @next = (ROOT);
    my @changes = ([0, 1], [1, 0]);
    my $level = 0;
    {
        my @temp_next;
        my @temp_changes;

        @changes = @temp_changes; 
        redo if !$graph->has_vertex($member);
    }
    return $graph;
}

sub curious_fraction_tree{
    my($member) = @_;
    my $graph = initialize($member);
    my($parent) = $graph->predecessors($member);
    my($grandparent) = $graph->predecessors($parent);

    print "parent = '$parent' and grandparent = '$grandparent'\n";
    print "\n";
    $member = "4/3";
    ($parent, $grandparent) = curious_fraction_tree($member);
    print "member = '$member'\n";
    print "parent = '$parent' and grandparent = '$grandparent'\n";
}
</code></pre>

<h3>Sample Run</h3>

<pre><code class="shell">
$ perl perl/ch-2.pl
member = '3/5'
parent = '3/2' and grandparent = '1/2'

member = '4/3'
parent = '1/3' and grandparent = '1/2'
</code></pre>

<h3>Notes</h3>

<p>My thought process on this problem started somewhat backwards. After reading the problem
statement I thought of the Graph module and remembered that it defines a function
<code>predecessors()</code> which would be very useful for this. After convincing myself to 
<code>use Graph;</code> I then probably spent the majority of the time for this just getting my 
head around how to define new vertices at each level of the tree. Like all trees there is
some recursiveness to the structure, but an iterative implementation still looks clean as
well.</p>

<p>Once the graph is constructed the solution as required comes from calling <code>predecessors()</code>
to get the parent and grandparent vertices.</p>

     <div class="card-body">       <div class="card-text"><p>What gets to be included in languages and what gets pushed into some third party library is a result of history more than reason.</p>

<p>For example pretty much every language comes with every possible trigonometric function included and preloaded, so you can run <code>Math.asinh(69.0)</code> without even requiring anything. What was the last time you wrote a program that needed <code>Math.asinh</code> in your program?</p>

<p>Meanwhile string matching and processing is about the most common thing programs do, but before Perl I don't think any general purpose language included regular expressions. It was something either text processing languages like sed and awk did, or left for third party libraries. Perl fully embraced them, made them far more powerful, and in the post-Perl era including regular expressions is just a normal natural thing languages do.</p>

<p>There's a similar story with package managers. First they didn't exist. Then they existed as poorly integrated third party tools like Ruby's rubygems, and JavaScript's npm. Nowadays, we expect every new language to simply have fully functioning package manager builtin.</p>

<p>Anyway, since days of Perl, Perl Compatible Regular Expressions, or their very close variant, and the default regular expression engine for new languages. Nobody serious considers using any of the pre-Perl regular expression systems, with their limitations and irregularities (but if you want to try some, UNIX <code>grep</code> command is still using stupid 1970s style regexps by default - even <code>a|b</code> is broken!). <a href="https://gist.github.com/CMCDragonkai/6c933f4a7d713ef712145c5eb94a1816">You can see some comparison chart here</a>, the pre-Perl and post-Perl divide is really apparent, even if they disagree on a few issues.</p>

<p>The only exception seems to be <a href="https://dev.to/taw/languages-speedrun-episode-26-raku-perl-6-4emf">Raku (originally known as Perl 6)</a>(<a href="https://taw.hashnode.dev/100-languages-speedrun-episode-26-raku-perl-6">https://taw.hashnode.dev/100-languages-speedrun-episode-26-raku-perl-6</a>), which decided to just design its own regular expression syntax, and it's about this sublanguage this episode is about.</p>

<h3>
  <a href="#i-found-a-massive-bug-in-raku-regular-expressions">
  </a>
  I found a massive bug in Raku Regular Expressions
</h3>

<p>Before I start, let's just get it out of the way - Raku has a massive design bug in its regular expressions:<br>
</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>#!/usr/bin/env raku

sub is_small_int($n) {
  !!($n ~~ /^ \d ** {1..6} $ /)
}

my @examples = (
  # Correctly True
  '0',
  '0001',
  '12345',
  # Correct False
  '-17',
  '1234567',
  '3.14',
  # Not ASCII digits
  '๓๓๓',
  '௫๓௫๓',
  '១๑໑',
);

for @examples -&gt; $n {
  say "is_small_int($n) = ", is_small_int($n);
}
</code></pre>

</div>



<p>What it does:<br>
</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>./raku_bug.raku
is_small_int(0) = True
is_small_int(0001) = True
is_small_int(12345) = True
is_small_int(-17) = False
is_small_int(1234567) = False
is_small_int(3.14) = False
is_small_int(๓๓๓) = True
is_small_int(௫๓௫๓) = True
is_small_int(១๑໑) = True
</code></pre>

</div>



<p>The last three examples are just plain incorrect.</p>

<p>The bug didn't take long to find - <a href="https://docs.raku.org/language/regexes">documentation for Raku regular expressions literally says this broken way is how <code>\d</code> works in Raku</a>.</p>

<p>So why I'm saying it's a bug? Because regular expressions need to be able to process computer data, and matching a digit (ASCII 0 to 9) is about the second most common thing to do after matching a literal characters. In the entire history of regular expressions, I don't know if there was even one case when someone actually wanted to match Unicode digits, and it's not like their job was hard, Raku has zero problems matching by Unicode properties:<br>
</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>#!/usr/bin/env raku

sub is_unicode_digits($n) {
  !!($n ~~ /^ &lt;:N&gt; ** {1..6} $ /)
}

my @examples = (
  # Correctly True
  '0',
  '0001',
  '12345',
  # Correct False
  '-17',
  '1234567',
  '3.14',
  # Non ASCII digits
  '๓๓๓',
  '௫๓௫๓',
  '១๑໑',
);

for @examples -&gt; $n {
  say "is_unicode_digits($n) = ", is_unicode_digits($n);
}
</code></pre>

</div>



<p>If I said that wanting to match <code>[0-9]</code> is approximately a MILLION times more common than wanting to match <code>&lt;:N&gt;</code>, I'd be massively understating my case. We might be dividing my zero and getting an infinity here.</p>

<p>And just to show that I'm right, the very same document that defines how <code>\d</code> works, then proceeds to casually assume <code>\d</code> will match ASCII numbers 0 to 9, with examples such as:<br>
</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>/ &lt;[\d] - [13579]&gt; /;
</code></pre>

</div>





<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>s/ (\d+)\-(\d+)\-(\d+) /today/;
</code></pre>

</div>





<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>s/ (\d+)\-(\d+)\-(\d+) /$1-$2-$0/;
</code></pre>

</div>





<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>my regex ipv4-octet { \d ** 1..3 &lt;?{ True }&gt; }
</code></pre>

</div>





<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>my regex number { \d+ [ \. \d+ ]? }
</code></pre>

</div>



<p>So without any doubt, Raku <code>\d</code> and <code>\D</code> are completely 100% broken, and hopefully they fix it, as broken <code>\d</code> means basically every regular expression will either be incorrect and potentially introduce security vulnerabilities, or people learn to avoid <code>\d</code> and use the extremely verbose <code>&lt;[0..9]&gt;</code> instead.</p>

<p>This is not a trivial problem. By a quick greps for regexps in a few codebases in a few languages, <code>\d</code> is indeed the most ubiquitous regexp escape code, and it's supposed to mean ASCII digits 0 to 9 every single time.</p>

<p>Raku didn't even come with this bug, another language was doing the same broken thing before. It's still 100% unquestionably broken.</p>

<h3>
  <a href="#regular-expression-basics">
  </a>
  Regular expression basics
</h3>

<p>Anyway, now that we got it out of the way, let's talk about Raku regular expressions basics.</p>

<p>Traditional regular expressions really overloaded a few special characters and their combinations to mean so many different things, so when a new feature was added, it had to use more and more nasty combination of same few special characters. Raku does a big restart, making some common regular expressions more verbose, but now it has a lot more syntax to work with.</p>

<p>As expected, regular expressions go between slashes <code>//</code>. You can match them with <code>~~</code>. A few common operations like substitution <code>s///</code> have extra syntax too.<br>
</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>#!/usr/bin/env raku

my $s = "Hello, World!";
say "We are saying Hello" if $s ~~ /Hello/;

$_ = "Hello, World!";
say "We are saying Hello" if m/Hello/;

# Spaces are ignored by default on the regexp side
# but not on substitution side
$_ = "Hello, World!";
s/ World /Alice/;
say $_;

# :i for case insensitive
$_ = "Hello, World!";
s:i/ world /Alice/;
say $_;

my $n = "Alice";
say "It is Alice" if $n ~~ regex {
  ^       # start of string
  (A | a) # lower or upper case A
  l       # lower case l
  i       # lower case i
  c       # lower case c
  e       # lower case e
  $       # end of string
}
</code></pre>

</div>



<p>There are a few obvious changes:</p>

<ul>
<li>spaces are ignored by default, so you can make regular expressions a lot more readable, with spacing, comments, and so on</li>
<li>switches go on the beginning not the end</li>
<li>
<code>^</code> and <code>$</code> are start and end of string, with no line stuff, and that's honestly a much more sensible default than complex rules traditional regular expressions had</li>
<li>many of the common things like <code>|</code> and <code>()</code> work just the same</li>
</ul>

<h3>
  <a href="#character-classes">
  </a>
  Character classes
</h3>

<p>Raku decided that very common task of a non-grouping match should get <code>[foo]</code> instead of <code>(?:foo)</code>. This meant that character classes now needed something more verbose so <code>[0-9]</code> is now <code>&lt;[0..9]&gt;</code>.<br>
</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>#!/usr/bin/env raku

<p>We still needed to do that in two parts as anchors are not part of the recurssion. I'm not sure if it's possible to do it with some <code>:</code> modifier, none of them seem to match.</p>

<h3>
  <a href="#fizzbuzz">
  </a>
  FizzBuzz
</h3>

<p>This lets us do the holy grail of regular expressions, the FizzBuzz regexp! For comparison, <a href="https://dev.to/taw/100-languages-speedrun-episode-07-sed-and-regular-expression-fizzbuzz-23l9">we did it with traditional regexp back in the Sed episode</a>(<a href="https://taw.hashnode.dev/100-languages-speedrun-episode-07-sed-and-regular-expression-fizzbuzz">https://taw.hashnode.dev/100-languages-speedrun-episode-07-sed-and-regular-expression-fizzbuzz</a>), and it was far more complex and completely unreadable. This one makes a lot of sense.</p>

<p>We just need one really useful feature - a regexp that two regexps match. <code>/ A &amp;&amp; B /</code> matches if both <code>A</code> and <code>B</code> match. In this case we have regexps for divisible by 3 and a very simple one for divisible by 5. Thanks to <code>&amp;&amp;</code> it's really easy to get divisibility by 15 from it.<br>

<h3>
  <a href="#should-you-use-raku-regular-expressions">
  </a>
  Should you use Raku Regular Expressions?
</h3>

<p>Regular expressions have a lot of features, so I could keep going, but these are likely the features you'd use the most.</p>

<p>I think most of the changes are sensible. Allowing free spacing and comments by default was much needed (most languages have some kind of support for it with <code>//x</code> etc., but because <code>x</code> goes on the end this causes a lot of parser confusion). Changing <code>^$</code> to be just the start and the end of the string with no special logic was a great change. <code>&amp;&amp;</code> was much needed, <code>** %</code> and <code>** %%</code> are very clever shortcuts for something very common, recursion can simplify a lot of regexps, <code>[]</code> for non-matching grouping is quite nice, and so on.</p>

<p>Of course all this needs to be balanced by <code>\d</code> being completely broken, and <code>\d</code> is about the most commonly used regex feature. The good thing is that it can be fixed in 100% compatible way! Just make <code>\d</code> match <code>0</code> to <code>9</code> and nothing else. Not only it will not break any software, as nobody in history ever relied on this broken <code>\d</code> behavior, but it will likely fix a lot of bug, and likely many security vulnerabilities as well.</p>

<p>It either gets fixed, or you'd need to keep telling people to never ever use <code>\d</code>, and good luck with that.</p>

<p>So if you're designing a new language and its regular expression system, you should definitely consider doing changes similar to what Raku did. But keep <code>\d</code> correct please.</p>

<p>Also, this is likely not going to be the final Raku episode, as Raku Grammars are another sublanguage I want to cover in this series.</p>

<p>Easy peasy. <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=what+is+the+10001+prime&amp;ia=web">Search</a> it, print 104743 and we are done. Well not quite, but still a valid solution :)</p>

<p>This is a relatively straight forward task. Create a method called <code>is_prime</code> to determine if a number is a prime. Then have a counter to find the 10,001st prime number.</p>

<p>The Perl solution is transliteration of the Python code.</p>

<h2>

  Task
</h2>

<p>Consider the following Curious Fraction Tree:</p>

<p><a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--e_k4W0NQ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/nci8upab8r4aevckt9p9.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--e_k4W0NQ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/nci8upab8r4aevckt9p9.png" alt="Image description" width="533" height="305"></a></p>

<p>You are given a fraction, member of the tree created similar to the above sample.</p>

<p>Write a script to find out the parent and grandparent of the given member.</p>

<h2>
  <a href="#my-solution">
  </a>
  My solution
</h2>

<p>Python has an <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/fractions.html">fractions</a> method. My original though was to create each level of the tree, and find out if we have a match.</p>

<p>However, looking at the tree, there is an obvious pattern to work out what the parent value is. If the fraction is greater than 1, we reduce the numerator (top value) by the value of the denominator (bottom value). If it is less than 1, we reduce the denominator by the numerator.</p>

<p>Using this theory, I have a method called <code>get_parent</code> that will return the parent Fraction value given a Fraction value. It will return None if it has no parent (either -1/1 or 1/1). I also have a method called <code>f</code> that generates a string to display as the Fractions str method, will not show the denominator if it is 1.</p>

<p>The Fraction method will automatically normalize the fraction. If we supply 6/-4, it will automatically become -3/2.</p>

<p>For the Perl solution, Dave Cross (a former Team PWC member) has written the <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Number::Fraction">Number::Fraction</a> CPAN module, which acts the same as the Python equivalent. Regular readers of my blog posts will know that I tend not to use non-core Perl modules. I've decided to ease up on this, as it seems pointless to reinvent the wheel.</p>

<p>The Perl solution has the same underlying logic as the Python version.</p>

<p>Let me start by welcoming you to the new year! Let me also use the opportunity to thank <a href="http://manwar.org/">Mohammad S. Anwar</a> for his dedication in both editing every other edition of the Perl Weekly Newsletter and his very own <a href="https://theweeklychallenge.org/">Weekly Challenge</a>. Let me also thank <a href="https://davecross.co.uk/">Dave Cross</a> for his immense help making our grammar a bit more bearable and the various Open Source projects he creates. (e.g. the <a href="https://cpandashboard.com/">CPAN Dashboard</a> or <a href="https://perl.theplanetarium.org/">The Perl Planetarium</a>). If you also like their work please thank them in an email, a blog post, or by supporting them via <a href="https://www.patreon.com/manwar/">Patreon for Mohammad</a> or via <a href="https://github.com/davorg/">GitHub for Dave</a>. They won't become wealthy from this, but receiving a paycheck every month from tens of supporters give a huge boost to the ego and makes one create even more for the public.</p>
<p>As for me, you might recall I've been learning Spanish for more than 3 years and started to learn Ladino (aka. Judeo-Spanish) a few weeks ago. Learning a foreign language is a totally different experience than learning a programming language. If for nothing else, because you don't get immediate feedback to your mistakes from a compiler. Well. Except if you use an application that helps you. My open source mindset quickly kicked in. I found an Open Source platform called <a href="https://librelingo.app/">LibreLingo</a> that will help you learn languages. It is still in very early version, but started to use that platform to be able to practice Ladino and also started to contribute to the project. I'll share more about it when enough progress was made to show something in public. Until then you are invited to check it out.</p>
<p>Enjoy the year ahead!</p>       </div><!-- card-text -->     </div>

<h4><a href="https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/15">Day 15</a> - Chiton</h4>

<p>Another path finder, this time with different costs for different paths. This screams for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm">Dijkstra</a>, but for part 1 I still did a more stupid brute force solution using code similar to Day 12 (but using a stack instead of recursion).</p>

<p>For part two my brute force solution was too slow, so I actually had to understand / implement Dijkstra, which took a bit of time, the Wikipedia article and <a href="https://www.redblobgames.com/pathfinding/a-star/introduction.html">this nice page</a>. It was still rather slow, because I used a plain Perl sort to sort the todo list. Then I thought that I could just group the nodes by cost, thinking (in error) that there would by only 9 buckets, but as each node stores the cumulative cost there are way more buckets. Then I looked into this thing called Heap that was all hot on reddit, and sped up my code a lot by using <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Heap::Simple">Heap::Simple</a>. Abigail has a very nice and detailed explanation of "Heap" on <a href="https://abigail.github.io/HTML/AdventOfCode/2021/day-15.html">his post about the 15th</a>.</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://github.com/domm/advent_of_code/blob/main/2021/15_2.pl">Part 2</a></li>
</ul>

<h4><a href="https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/16">Day 16</a> - Packet Decoder</h4>

<p>Yay, decoding a binary protocol!</p>

<p>First, I decode the input into a binary string:</p>

<pre><code>my $bits = join( '', map { sprintf( &quot;%.4b&quot;, hex( '0x' . $_ ) ) } split( //, $ARGV[0] || &lt;&gt; ) );</code></pre>

<p>Reading that from right to left, we first either read in a file or take the input directly from the command line, and split it into single characters (<code>split //</code>), the interpret that char as a hex value (<code>hex('0x'.$_)</code>) and convert it into a four bit 0/1 string (<code>sprintf( &quot;%.4b&quot;, ..)</code>).</p>

<p>Then we "just" need to take a few bits of that string (I use <code>substr</code> to bite of the correct sizes) to get the <code>version</code> and <code>type_id</code>, and handle the next bits based on the type. As we're dealing with packets that can contain subpackets, I implemented all of this in a recursive function, where the most fiddly stuff was to make sure that the correct number of bits stay on the input stream.</p>

<p>I liked it!</p>

<li><a href="https://github.com/domm/advent_of_code/blob/main/2021/16_2.pl">Part 2</a></li>
</ul>

<h4><a href="https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/17">Day 17</a> - Trick Shot</h4>

<p>I spend some time thinking about math-y ways to solve the problem, but only figured out a way to calc the bounds for <code>x</code>. For part 1, I looped through all <code>y</code> between shooting straight down and double the max depths, and got my result. For part 2 the same interval also worked, so I just needed to adjust the calculation of the winning shot.</p>

<p>I liked how I parsed the input, using the return values of the regex:</p>

<pre><code>my ($xfrom, $xto, $yto, $yfrom) = $in =~ /x=(-?\d+)..(-?\d+), y=(-?\d+)..(-?\d+)/;</code></pre>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/domm/advent_of_code/blob/main/2021/17_1.pl">Part 1</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/domm/advent_of_code/blob/main/2021/17_2.pl">Part 2</a></li>
</ul>

<h4>Day 18 &amp; 19</h4>

<p>I skipped those two days (for now), because they seemed quite complex, and I had family stuff to do on the weekend.</p>

<h4><a href="https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/20">Day 20</a> - Trench Map</h4>

<p>This was a bit too tricky for me. I got part 1 working quite easily for the test data, but it did not work for the live data (which was the actual tricky bit here). After working through some solutions on reddit I finally figured out how to handle the blinking background, solving both parts with the same code:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/domm/advent_of_code/blob/main/2021/20_1.pl">Part 1 &amp; 2</a></li>
</ul>

<h4><a href="https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/21">Day 21</a> - Dirac Dice</h4>

<p>Here I found the first part quite easy, though I still have problems implementing a <span cite="http://">modulo</span> that works from 1 to 10 instead of 0 to 9:</p>

<pre><code> my $pos = ( $board{$player}-&gt;{pos} + $roll ) % 10;
 $pos = 10 if $pos == 0;</code></pre>

<p>I did not try the second part, because I was busy with Christmas preparations (in my case, producing my <a href="/mixtapes/in_einer_leiwandn_herdn.html">mixtape</a>)</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/domm/advent_of_code/blob/main/2021/21_1.pl">Part 1</a></li>
</ul>

<h4><a href="https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/22">Day 22</a> - Reactor Reboot</h4>

<p>I did a quick brute force for part 1, knowing very well that this approach will not work for the second part (where I assumed (correctly) we cannot just ignore the values outside -50:50). I thought a bit about how to intersect cubes, but again had other things to do, and not enough math-power.. So part 2 will have to be solved later</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/domm/advent_of_code/blob/main/2021/22_1.pl">Part 1</a></li>
</ul>

<h4><a href="https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/24">Day 24</a> - Arithmetic Logic Unit</h4>

<p>I skipped day 23 and 24 (again because of Christmas..), but spend some time on the 25th to solve day 24.</p>

<p>Of course I fell for the trap and implemented the <span class="caps">ALU </span>(so much simpler than Intcode!) and could output 4 bit numbers easily. But using my virtual machine to brute-force the model number would take ages.</p>

<p>So after some reading reddit I found <a href="https://github.com/dphilipson/advent-of-code-2021/blob/master/src/days/day24.rs">this solution</a> which very nicely explained how to reverse-engineer the input code to figure out which lines in the code where actually relevant. I then used <strong>this</strong> as my actual task and wrote some code to extract the relevant lines from my input, do the correct stack manipulations and just output the rules for the different numbers (the 5th number has to be 3 larger then the 11th number, etc):</p>

<pre><code> my @stack;
 my %rules;
 for my $i (1..14) {
     my $prog = $progs[$i];
     my $check = $prog-&gt;[5]-&gt;[2];
     my $offset = $prog-&gt;[15]-&gt;[2];
     if ($check &gt; 0) {
         push(@stack,[$i,$offset]);
     }
     else {
         my $old = pop(@stack);
         my $calc = $old-&gt;[1] + $check;
         $rules{$i} = [$old-&gt;[0],$calc];
     }
 }</code></pre>

<p>And then calculated the biggest/smallest serial number by hand.</p>

<p>But because I had some more appetite for coding, I also implemented an automatic solver:</p>

<pre><code> my @high=' ';
 my @low= ' ';
 while (my ($pos, $rule) = each %rules) {
     if ($rule-&gt;[1] &lt;= 0) {
         $high[$rule-&gt;[0]] = 9;
         $high[$pos] = 9 + $rule-&gt;[1];
         $low[$pos]=1;
         $low[$rule-&gt;[0]]= 1 - $rule-&gt;[1] ;
     }
     else {
         $high[$pos] = 9;
         $high[$rule-&gt;[0]] = 9 - $rule-&gt;[1];
         $low[$rule-&gt;[0]] = 1;
         $low[$pos] = 1 + $rule-&gt;[1];
     }
 }
 
 say &quot;high: &quot;.join('',@high);
 say &quot;low:  &quot;.join('',@low);</code></pre>

<p>Very nice, but I could have never come up with the actual solution on my own.</p>

<h4>The rest...</h4>

<p>I do plan to try to tackle the remaining tasks, but it might take some time, as we have a rather big roll-out of a project that has been in the work the last 1.5 years in the next week...</p>

<p>But it was another very nice Advent of Code. Thanks, Eric, and all the other people who helped make this work, and who posted their solutions and explanations!</p>       </div><!-- card-text -->     </div>

     <div class="card-body">       <div class="card-text"><p>Hi there</p>
<p>We wish all the readers of the newsletter, <strong>Merry Christmas</strong>. I hope and wish you are all enjoying quality time with your loved ones.</p>
<p>Belated happy birthday to my favourite language, <strong>Perl</strong>, on completing 34 years. <strong>Mark Gardner</strong> used his weekly blogging schedule to celebrate the occassion in his <a href="https://phoenixtrap.com/2021/12/21/34-at-34-for-v5-34-modern-perl-features-for-perls-birthday">blog post</a>.</p>
<p>Do you remember which year you first picked up the <strong>Perl</strong> language?</p>
<p>For me, I was introduced to <strong>Perl</strong> in the year 1998. So technically, I am 23 Perl years old. How about you? I am wondering if anyone other than the creator picked the language in the first year that it existed. If you know their name then please do share it with us. I am sure there must be a handful of people that I am not aware of.</p>
<p>Talking about birthday celebrations, I would like to wish belated Happy Birthday to the mother of our chief editor, <strong>Gabor Szabo</strong>. As per the record, my birthday was last Monday i.e. <strong>20th December</strong>. To date, I have never celebrated my birthday, this year also went without celebration.</p>
<p>I noticed that I am getting close to my <strong>100th edition</strong> of the newsletter. This is my <strong>94th edition</strong>. It would be a big achievement for me, personally, to reach that number. I am looking forward to the <strong>556th edition</strong> of the weekly newsletter as that will be my <strong>100th edition</strong>.</p>
<p>Stay safe and enjoy the holiday break.</p>       </div><!-- card-text -->     </div>

<h1>Merry Christmas and Happy New Year! May 2022 bring you less COVID and more Perl projects!</h1>

<p><em>The examples used here are from The Weekly Challenge problem statement and demonstrate 
the working solution.</em></p>

<h2>Part 1</h2>

<p><em>Write a script to generate all Semiprime numbers &lt;= 100.</em> </p>

<h3>Solution</h3>

<pre><code class="perl">
use strict;
use warnings;
use boolean; 
use LWP::UserAgent;
use constant N => 100; 
use constant PRIME_URL => "http://primes.utm.edu/lists/small/100000.txt";

sub get_primes{
    my @primes;
    my $ua = new LWP::UserAgent(
        ssl_opts => {verify_hostname => 0}
    );
    my $response = $ua->get(PRIME_URL);
    my @lines = split(/\n/,$response->decoded_content);
    foreach my $line (@lines){
        my @p = split(/\s+/, $line);
        unless(@p < 10){
            push @primes, @p[1..(@p - 1)];
        }
    }
    return @primes;
}

sub factor{
    my($n) = @_;
    my @factors = ();
    for  my $j (2 .. sqrt($n)){
        if($j**2 == $n){  
            push @factors, [$j, $j] if $j**2 == $n;
            next; 
        }
        push @factors, [$j, $n / $j] if $n % $j == 0;

    my @factors = factor($n);
    return false if @factors != 1;  
    my @prime_factors = grep {$factors[0]->[0] == $_ || $factors[0]->[1] == $_} @{$primes};     
    return true if @prime_factors == 2 || $prime_factors[0]**2 == $n; 
    return false; 
}

sub semiprime_n{

    for my $n (1 .. N){
        print "$n " if semiprime($n, \@primes);   
    } 
    print "\n"; 
}

MAIN:{
    semiprime_n;
}
</code></pre>

<h3>Sample Run</h3>

<pre><code class="shell">
$ perl ch-1.pl
4 6 9 10 14 15 21 22 25 26 33 34 35 38 39 46 49 51 55 57 58 62 65 69 74 77 82 85 86 87 91 93 94 95
</code></pre>

<h3>Notes</h3>

<p>I am sticking to the convention that I started a while back to not re-compute prime 
numbers myself, but instead just grab them from one of several convenient online sources.
The URL in the code above requires only a small amount of effort to scrape and parse. I 
hope nobody minds the little bit of extra traffic to their site!</p>

<p><em>Please do check out their main page listed below. It's a fun resource with interesting 
facts and news on prime numbers and related research.</em></p>

<p>Once the list of the first 100k primes is obtained (that's more than enough for any of 
these challenges) we proceed to factor and test candidate numbers. Provided the number
has only two factors (which may be equal) and both of them are prime then it passes the 
semiprime test.</p>

<h2>Part 2</h2>

<p><em>You are given two positive numbers, $u and $v. Write a script to generate Ulam Sequence 
having at least 10 Ulam numbers where $u and $v are the first 2 Ulam numbers.</em></p>

<h3>Solution</h3>

<pre><code class="perl">
use strict;
use warnings;
use constant ULAM_LIMIT => 10;   

sub ulam{
    my($u, $v) = @_;    
    my %pairs; 
    my @ulam = ($u, $v); 
    my $w = $u + $v;  
    push @ulam, $w;  
    $pairs{"$u,$v"} = $w; 
    $pairs{"$u,$w"} = $u + $w;

    do{
        my @sums = sort {$a <=> $b} grep{my $sum = $_; my @values = grep{$sum == $_} values %pairs; $sum if @values == 1 && $sum > $ulam[@ulam - 1]} values %pairs; 
        my $u = $sums[0]; 
        push @ulam, $u;

<h3>Sample Run</h3>

<pre><code class="shell">
$ perl perl/ch-2.pl
1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 11, 13, 16, 18
2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9, 13, 14, 18, 19
2, 5, 7, 9, 11, 12, 13, 15, 19, 23
</code></pre>

<h3>Notes</h3>

<p>The code here is a pretty direct translation of the definition: the next member of the
sequence must be a sum of two previous members which is greater than the previous member
and only be obtainable one way. Here that is done with a <code>grep</code> filter, with the sequence
itself being stored in an array, but for convenience the sums of all unique previous pairs
are kept in a hash.</p>

     <p>(published on behalf of TPF and Marketing Committee)</p>

<p>With the end of the year quickly approaching, The Perl Foundation want to thank you for all that you do in supporting us. Your support has allowed us to make significant strides in advancing the Perl and Raku languages, and the software behind them. There is, however, much work that still needs to be done.</p>

<p>As you consider your year-end philanthropy, we want to highlight a few strategies that may reduce your tax liability. Your gift to The Perl Foundation may be tax-deductible, so now is a great time to help us pave the way for another successful year at TPF.</p>

<p>(Please consult your tax advisor for information on your specific circumstances. This article should not be considered tax or financial advice).</p>

<p><strong>Gifts of Cash - Extensions for 2021</strong></p>

<p>"Above-the-Line" Deduction for Cash Gifts Extended and Expanded in 2021 - The $300 above-the-line deduction established in 2020 for gifts of cash by a non-itemizer (excluding donor advised funds or supporting organizations) has been extended and expanded to $600 for those filing jointly for the 2021 tax year. So, even if you are not planning to itemize your deductions for 2021, you can still take advantage of this tax benefit.  Speak to your accountant and <a href="https://www.perlfoundation.org/payments.html">make donations.</a> </p>

<p><strong>Increase in Charitable Deduction Limit</strong></p>

<p>The increase in the itemized deduction for cash contributions to public charities of 60% to 100% of adjusted gross income has been extended to include the 2021 tax year.  Speak to your accountant and <a href="https://www.perlfoundation.org/payments.html">make donations.</a> </p>

<p><strong>Additional Tax Advantageous Giving Strategies</strong></p>

<p>Gifts of Long-Term Appreciated Securities:  In many cases, a gift of long-term appreciated securities is more tax advantageous than giving cash because capital gains taxes can be avoided. This can be especially useful in optimizing your tax benefits if you are not itemizing deductions in a given year. </p>

<p>IRA Charitable Rollover Gifts: If you are 70 years and six months of age or older, the IRS may allow you to make a qualified charitable distribution of up to $100,000 directly to The Perl Foundation from a traditional Individual Retirement Account (IRA). The benefit of donating through a rollover is that you will be able to avoid reporting the income. </p>

<p>Speak to your accountant to learn more about theses two options.</p>

<p>Thank you for being such an important part of our work at The Perl Foundation. Your support makes it possible for us to do the daily work growing Perl and Raku.</p>

<h2>Come to the Perl and Raku Conference in Houston!</h2>

<p>We can't wait to see everyone in person at the 2022 Perl and Raku Conference June 21-25 2022! </p>

<p>You can expect to see a lot of presentations on Perl, Raku, and supporting languages. Core presentation topics in the past have included Perl 5 and Raku. Organizers are hopeful to continue with a core of Perl 5 and Raku moving forward. It’s worth noting that this event is run by volunteers and talks are also given by volunteers. The presentations at the conference are being submitted now during our Call For Presenters (CFP) and will be selected by organizers who volunteer to be on our talks-committee. Generally, there are sets of 3 to 4 simultaneous presentations (20-50 minutes long) on a variety of topics throughout each main event day. Surrounding the main conference days, master-class tutorial sessions (half day and full day format) are offered for an additional fee.</p>

<p>If you see <strong>#TPRCHouston</strong> around on social media, that’s our tag for The Perl Conference in Houston.</p>

<p>The website is live! There are still a few details we're filling in like how to book a room and of course the schedule, but there's still a bunch of information you can get by visiting https://perlconference.us</p>

<h2>Call for Presenters</h2>

<p>The call for presentations is open now! We will have an early submission deadline of 12 noon UTC, Tuesday February 1st. The final deadline for speaker submissions is 12 noon, Tuesday March 1st. Submit your talk ideas here: https://perlconference.us/speakers</p>

<p>Whether this is your first time submitting a talk proposal or one of many you’ve proposed and presented, consider submitting your talk idea to us. Making a presentation at a national event is great for networking and experience! </p>

<p>The presentations at the conference are selected by organizers who volunteer to be on our Talks Committee. Generally, there are sets of 3 to 4 simultaneous presentations (20 or 50 minutes long, including Q&amp;A) on a variety of technical topics throughout each main event day. </p>

<p>Not sure you are up for giving a talk but have a topic you’d like to learn more about at our event? Tweet <a href="https://twitter.com/PerlConferences">@PerlConferences</a> using <strong>#TPRCHouston</strong> or email <a href="mailto:admin@perlconference.us">admin@perlconference.us</a>.</p>

<h2>Call for Teachers/Master-Class</h2>

<p>We need to fill out our master-class/tutorial schedule. All tutorial ideas will be considered. You can submit your class idea to https://perlconference.us/speakers. We will get back to you quickly.</p>

<p>Keep in mind, the event schedule differs from some of the past events. Master-class tutorial sessions surrounding the main event and will be held on Jun 21 (Tuesday) and Jun 25 (Saturday).</p>

<h2>What presentations are you hoping to see?</h2>

<p>We’d love to hear your tech talk ideas for TPRCHouston! We’ve already received some interest in the following topics:</p>

<ul>
<li>Perl and Raku / Internet / History game show</li>
<li>Security</li>
<li>Fun side projects with Perl and Raku</li>
<li>Integrating Perl and Raku with other tools</li>
</ul>

<p>Got some more talk suggestions? Tweet <a href="https://twitter.com/PerlConferences">@PerlConferences</a> using <strong>#TPRCHouston</strong> or email <a href="mailto:admin@perlconference.us">admin@perlconference.us</a>.</p>

<h2>Be part of it all - Organizer spots open!</h2>

<p>Planning for The Perl Conference in Houston is underway and we need a few more hands! It’s not too late to join us in planning this event! Openings are web design/content editor, speaking coordinator, outreach assistant, and more... Email <a href="mailto:admin@perlconference.us">admin@perlconference.us</a> to volunteer. You can help frame the conference! </p>

<h2>Call for Sponsors!</h2>

<p>A donation to The Perl Foundation not only contributes to the Perl Conference in Houston, but also aids our other outreach programs. Perl Foundation Sponsors will get recognition for supporting The Perl Conference as well as our regional Perl Workshops, beginner training initiatives, and our grants programs for an entire year. Donating directly to The Perl Foundation provides the most value for your sponsorship money.</p>

<p>However, sponsors can also donate directly to The Perl Conference. Often the organizers are able to link a sponsor directly to an event at the conference (wifi, coffee break, etc.)  where the cost of the event is in line with the donation amount.</p>

<p>Sponsors of $500 or more will be provided a table at our sponsor expo and job fair. </p>

<p>Today we are celebrating the 80th birthday of my mother. Due to the pandemic we cannot celebrate in the same space, but we have collected some videos from the family members and her friends and we are going to have a Zoom session. Much better than not being able to celebrate at all. Happy birthday mom!</p>
<p>In a few days a large part of the world is going to celebrate the birthday of another Jew.</p>

use constant MULTIPLY => "10 * 8";

<p>TWCCalculator.yp (the Parse::Yapp code). This file is used to generate a parser module,

<h3>Notes</h3>

<p>In a long ago (almost exactly two years!) Challenge we were asked to implement a Reverse
Polish Notation (RPN) Calculator. For that challenge I wrote a short introduction to the 
parser module, Parse::Yapp, that I used. See the references below, I think it still holds
up.</p>

<p>For this challenge I was able to rely pretty heavily on that older code. I simply changed
the expected position of the operators and that was about it!</p>

<p>I really like any excuse to use a parser generator, they're a powerful tool one can have
at the disposal for a fairly small investment of learning time. Well, practical usage
may be quick to learn. Depending on how deep one wants to go there is the possibility also
of a lifetime of study of computational linguistics.</p>

<h2>Part 2</h2>

<p><em>You are given a positive number, $n. Write a script to find out if the given number is a
Stealthy Number.</em></p>

<h3>Solution</h3>

<pre><code class="perl">
use strict;
use warnings;
use boolean; 

sub factor{
    my($n) = @_;
    my @factors = ();
    for  my $j (2 .. sqrt($n)){
        push @factors, [$j, $n / $j] if $n % $j == 0;
    }
    return @factors;  
}

sub stealthy{
    my($n) = @_;
    my @factors = factor($n);
    for(my $i = 0; $i < @factors; $i++){
        for(my $j = 0; $j < @factors; $j++){
            unless($i == $j){
                my($s, $t) = @{$factors[$i]}; 
                my($u, $v) = @{$factors[$j]}; 
                return true if $s + $t == $u + $v + 1; 
            }  
        }  
    }  
    return false; 
}

MAIN:{
    print stealthy(12) . "\n";
    print stealthy(36) . "\n";
    print stealthy(6)  . "\n";
}
</code></pre>

<h3>Sample Run</h3>

<pre><code class="shell">
$ perl perl/ch-2.pl
1
1
0
</code></pre>

<h3>Notes</h3>

<p>That <code>factor</code> subroutine makes another appearance! Well, here there is a slight 
modification to get it to return the factors in pairs, each pair an array reference.
These are all checked in a loop for the desired property.</p>

<p>This is a classic "generate and test" approach. For an idea of what it would look like
to instead constrain the variables to fit the property and then discover which values, if 
any, match these constraints then please do take a look at my 
<a href="http://www.rabbitfarm.com/cgi-bin/blosxom/2021/12/19/prolog">Prolog solution for Challenge 143</a>
which uses a Constraint Logic Programming over Finite Domains (clpfd) approach.</p>

<p>For <a href="https://github.com/domm/advent_of_code/blob/main/2021/09_1.pl">part 1</a> I used a hash to store the map (with keys like "3_2" for row 3/col 2), and looked in the 4 bordering fields to find lower values (adjusting for corners/borders), I use the classic method (learned in previous years) of looping through a list of offsets to look for the neighbouring values:</p>

<pre><code>for my $move ([-1,0],[1,0],[0,-1],[0,1]) {
     my $look = ($r + $move-&gt;[0] ).':'.($c + $move-&gt;[1]);
     my $val = $map{ $look };
     ...
 }</code></pre>

<p>If the value I'm looking at is lower than all the four neighbours, count it. I needed to implement some special cases for the rows at the edges of the map, which could have been avoided if I had remembered another class trick: Pad the map with some values (in this case, <code>9</code> is perfect, because it's the highest values, thus ensuring that all other values are lower). See for example <a href="https://abigail.github.io/HTML/AdventOfCode/2021/day-09.html">Abigail's solution</a>.</p>

<p>For <a href="https://github.com/domm/advent_of_code/blob/main/2021/09_2.pl">part 2</a> I found the joining/splitting of row/cols too annoying so rewrote to a two-dim array. Used a recursive function to walk the map, starting from the low points. After visiting a location, I set it to -1, and stopped when hitting a 9 (or a previously visited -1).</p>

<p>The solutions is quite long because it builds on the solution for part 1 to find the low points. I guess it could be shortened quite bit...</p>

</ul>

<h4><a href="https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/10">Day 10</a> - Syntax Scoring</h4>

<p>I found this day quite easy (definitely easier than some earlier days), and it took me longer to get the points calculation right than to figure out the closing parens (using a simple stack onto which I push open chars, and then check if we have a matching closing one).</p>

<p>While these solutions could be heavily golfed, I leave then at their current very readable state - if not only to fight certain prejudices against Perl :-)</p>

</ul>

<h4><a href="https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/11">Day 11</a> - Dumbo Octopus</h4>

<p>Finally, a Game-of-Life-y task. And not too hard. But I wasted some time on the first part because I did the general increment of the octopus in the same step as the flashing, which worked for the first few rows and generations, but later broke down.</p>

<p>This time we need to look at all the 8 neighbours in a grid, so the list of "movement" (in fact, look-instructions) was a bit longer than on day 9:</p>

<pre><code>[-1,-1],[-1,0],[-1,1],[0,-1],[0,1],[1,-1],[1,0],[1,1]</code></pre>

<p>Oh, and also I find it <b>much easier</b> to work with rows <code>$r</code> and columns <code>$c</code> instead of <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>.</p>

<p>On this day I started to think about creating something like Acme::AdventOfCode containing a grab-bag of helpful functions (parse a map, draw a map, etc). Maybe I'll prepare something later / next year...</p>

<p>For part 2 I just needed to replace the <code>for</code> loop with a <code>while (1)</code> and stop when all octopus flash.</p>

<p>Here's a very nice visualisation using an <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/re000o/2021_day_11_part_2_c_trying_to_do_everything_on/">arduino</a></p>

<h4><a href="https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/12">Day 12</a> - Passage Pathing</h4>

<p>I had a family event on Sunday, so only got to work on the tasks in the evening, and was not very motivated. Also, this was a rather standard path solving / graph traversal. So here is my boring code (which was cheated^winsipired by reading a few of the solutions on reddit)</p>

</ul>

<h4><a href="https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/13">Day 13</a> - Transparent Origami</h4>

<p>Again a very nice task! We need to "fold" a very big piece of transparent paper that's marked with some dots. After a physically impossible number of folds a code will appear (that was part 2, part 1 just tested the basic folding algorithm).</p>

<p>Here you can watch somebody <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/rfp213/2021_day_13_folding_with_a_folding_phone/">solving it on a folding phone</a>.</p>

<p>For the <a href="https://github.com/domm/advent_of_code/blob/main/2021/13_1.pl">first part</a> (not cleaned up) I tried to be smart and only implement one folding dimension, and just rotate the map for the other dimension. But unfortunately I'm too stupid to come up with a working matrix rotation in 10 minutes, so I just copied the folding algorithm and adapted it for the other dimension.</p>

<p>I also got a wrong result first, because when the instructions said we should "count the dots", I counted the actual dots <code>.</code>, but those represent emptiness, and we need to count <code>#</code> which represent the dots. I wonder if this was worded like that on purpose..</p>

<p>For the <a href="https://github.com/domm/advent_of_code/blob/main/2021/13_2.pl">second part</a> (after submitting it..) I replaced the <code>#</code> with <code>█</code>, which makes for much easier to read output. Oh, and I had to adapt the folding algorithm a bit to align the folded parts on the fold, and not on the top row:</p>

<pre><code>splice( @map, $at, 1 );                       # remove the fold
 my @low = splice( @map, $at, @map - $at );    # fold it
 my $r   = @map - @low;                        # make sure the fold aligns
 for my $folded ( reverse @low ) {
     my $c = 0;
     for my $mark (@$folded) {
         $map[$r][$c] = $mark if $mark eq '█';    # rub through
         $c++;
     }
     $r++;
 }</code></pre>

<p>Notice the line with the comment "make sure the fold aligns", where I adjust the starting row to the difference between the two parts of the fold. This was only needed for one fold (for my input), but I still added to both cases.</p>

<p>Here's the output without the fold-alignment-fix:</p>

<pre><code>   █  ████  ███ █ ██ █    ████ █ ██ █  █ 
   ██ ██ █ █  █ ████ █    █ ██ ████ ████

  ██  █ ██ ████ ███  ███  ████ █ ██ █  █ </code></pre>

<p>One could try to guess, but fixing it was easier and yields"</p>

<pre><code>   ██ ███  ████ ███  █     ██  █  █ █  █

</ul>

<p>This was the first time I got a 4-digit rank (8532 / 9122), but not because I was especially fast / smart, but because I woke up very early and couldn't get back to sleep, and thus started at ~6:30 (local time)</p>

<h4><a href="https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/14">Day 14</a> - Extended Polymerization</h4>

<p>I had 20 minutes time until a meeting started, so I ignored the "This polymer grows quickly" warning for the first part, and implemented an array based solution:</p>

<pre><code>for my $step (1 .. 10) {
    my @new;
    for (my $i=0; $i&lt;@poly-1; $i++) {
        push( @new, $rules{$poly[$i].$poly[$i+1]}-&gt;@* );
    }
    push( @new, $poly[-1] );
    @poly = @new;
 }</code></pre>

<p>This looks up the current pair (<code>$poly[$i].$poly[$i+1]</code>) in the list of rules, where for example <code>'NH'</code> will return <code>'NC','CH'</code> and push the two new pairs onto the new version of the polymer.</p>

<p>Worked like a charm for <a href="https://github.com/domm/advent_of_code/blob/main/2021/14_1.pl">part 1</a>. But died after ~22 steps (far from the 40 steps required for part 2) for lack of <span class="caps">RAM </span>(and I have loads!).</p>

<p>During my meeting (ahem..) I fiddled a bit with the output to check if there is some regularity I could use to just forecast the result. There wasn't. Linked lists also did not seem reasonable, because we didn't need to insert stuff somewhere into an array. (Linked lists where used in previous years when plain arrays where to slow)</p>

<p>So I couldn't resist to check <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/">reddit</a> (the meeting was still ongoing..) where I was greeted by a lot of <a href="/perl/2021_aoc_day_06_to_08.html">Lanternfish</a> memes. Then it made click.</p>

<p>I was <b>again</b> fooled by the array-heavy problem description, when in fact all we had to do was count the pairs (of which there where only a few), and increment the pairs based on the rules: So if I see <code>NH</code> (and we already have 10 of them), I just need to increment the counter of <code>NC</code> and <code>CH</code> by 10:</p>

<pre><code>for my $step (1 .. 40) {
     my %new;
     while (my ($pair,$count) = each %pairs) {
         $new{ $rules{$pair}[0] } += $count;
         $new{ $rules{$pair}[1] } += $count;
     }
     %pairs = %new;
 }</code></pre>

<p>The rest was a bit of fiddling with the resulting pair counts to count each letter, not forgetting that the last letter in the original input has to be added once by hand:</p>

<pre><code>my %count = ($poly[-1] =&gt; 1);
 while (my ($pair,$count) = each %pairs) {
     my ($f,$s)=split(//,$pair);
     $count{$f}+=$count;
 }</code></pre>

<p>Sort and subtract, and done!</p>

     <div class="card-body">       <div class="card-text"><p>Hi there</p>
<p>How you all doing? Are you making the most of the festive season?</p>
<p>In the <a href="https://perlweekly.com/archive/540.html">540th edition</a> of the weekly newsletter, I mentioned <strong>Advent Calendars</strong>. I noticed some activity in the GitHub repository for the <strong>Perl Advent Calendar</strong> and was hoping to see another exciting edition full of Perl projects. A friend of mine on <strong>Facebook</strong> mentioned that this year the <a href="http://perladvent.org/2021/index.html">Perl Advent Calendar</a> is looking a bit sparse. At the time of writing this editorial, I have only seen <a href="http://perladvent.org/2021/2021-12-01.html">one post</a> i.e. Day 1 of Year 2021. Being one of many contributors in the past, I am sad to see the current state of the project. I have absolutely no idea what happened this year. I know I have too many things already on my plate but I would like to help to get the <strong>Perl Advent Calendar</strong> back to its original glory.</p>
<p>Talking about <strong>Advent Calendars</strong>, I would like to mention <a href="https://theweeklychallenge.org/blog/advent-calendar-2021">The Weekly Challenge Advent Calendar</a> which has mix of <strong>Perl</strong> and <strong>Raku</strong> like in the past. We have been running this since the beginning i.e. <strong>2019</strong>. You will find some of the fun tasks from the past year being discussed by members of <strong>Team PWC</strong>. I have made a slight change to the look and feel this year. I hope you like it.</p>
<p>How about the <a href="https://24pullrequests.com">24 Pull Requests</a> event?</p>
<p>I have not seen it being discussed either on any of the social platforms e.g. <strong>Facebook</strong>, <strong>Twitter</strong> or <strong>LinkedIn</strong>. I haven't had chance to take part this year. I couldn't take part last year either; what a shame. I still have 10 days and I have booked a few days off work. So there is a possibility I might take part and even complete the challenge. Please wish me luck.</p>
<p>Last but not least, <strong>Curtis</strong>, leader of the <strong>Corinna</strong> project, announced that he had a great meeting with the Perl Steering Council and they are extremely receptive to Corinna going into the core. I can't wait for <strong>Corinna</strong> to be part of core Perl. <strong>Damian</strong> shared the details on one of issues discussed in the same meeting in a <a href="http://blogs.perl.org/users/damian_conway/2021/12/a-not-so-simple-matter-of-privacy.html">blog post</a>. You definitely don't want to miss it.</p>

<h2>Part 1</h2>

<p><em>You are given positive integers, $m and $n. Write a script to find total count of

<h3>Solution</h3>

<pre><code class="perl">

<h3>Notes</h3>

<p>I hope participants in The Weekly Challenge enjoyed this! After I saw Jort Sort in 
Challenge 139 I was reminded of other joke sorts and suggested this as a future challenge.
Happily the suggestion was accepted!</p>

<p>Threading is easy in Perl, which uses an "Interpreter Threads" ("ithreads") model. 
Node.js programmers will find this model familiar as it is exactly what that language 
uses. Unfortunately Perl's documentation writers are not as familiar with concurrent and 
parallel programming topics and some of the official documentation needs updating. 
Unfortunately, this is a bizarrely 
<a href="https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/14691">contentious issue</a>. </p>

<p><em>To ensure you are using a perl interpreter with proper ithreads support try this 
one-liner: <code>$ perl -Mthreads -e 0</code>. If that runs without error you are good to go! If you
get an error you'll need to install a new perl. One convenient option is to use 
<a href="https://perlbrew.pl/">Perlbrew</a>. After installing <code>perlbrew</code> you'll need to invoke it
like this <code>perlbrew install perl-5.34.0 -Dusethreads</code>. Please see the Perlbrew 
documentation for additional (straightforward) details if you decide to undertake this.</em></p>

<p>Here rather than <code>use threads</code> directly <code>Thread::Pool</code> is used. This is a convenient
pattern for using Perl's ithreads. Since each ithread is really a new perl interpreter 
process this allows for some fine tuning of the number of ithreads created to help 
conserve memory usage. In this case the memory conservation is actually somewhat minimal
since Sleep Sort requires us to start a new ithread for each element of the array to be 
sorted. Amusingly, because of the process based threading model, we can quickly crash the 
program by attempting to sort an array whose size causes the system to exceed the number
of allowed processes. Remember, this is a joke sort, right!?!?</p>

<p>Typically you'd create a pool of workers whose number matched the number of CPU cores
available. That way each core could be tasked by the OS for whatever CPU intensive code
you'd care to run without the ithreads competing too badly with each other.</p>

<p>Concurrent and parallel programming issues are somewhat advanced. Excellent documentation
exists that is both Perl specific and more general. Be sure to understand the difference 
between ithreads and so called "co-operative thread" models (as used in modules such as
Coro. The "advanced" nature of this topic is due to understanding the various trade-offs 
at play. Deep understanding usually comes from experience of implementing solutions this
way and study of the underlying Operating System concepts. Even the most modest modern
computer systems systems available have multiple cores at your disposal as a programmer
so this effort is certainly worthwhile! The bibliography of <code>perlthrtut</code> is an excellent
starting point.</p>
