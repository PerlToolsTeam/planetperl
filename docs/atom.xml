<p><strong>Celebration time ...</strong></p>

<p>The month of <strong>March</strong> is very special to me. It was in this month 2 years ago, I started my dream project <a href="https://perlweeklychallenge.org/">The Weekly Challenge (a.k.a. Perl Weekly Challenge)</a>.</p>

<p>For <strong>Team PWC</strong>, it was back to back celebrations. We celebrated <strong>100th</strong> week challenge in <strong>February</strong> first followed by completion of <strong>2 years</strong> in <strong>March</strong>. In fact for the second year anniversary, I had planned something bigger but unfortunately it didn't work out for some reason. Having said that, for me the biggest achievement is that we now have a platform where everyone is welcome. It doesn't matter whether you like <strong>Perl</strong> or <strong>Raku</strong> or for that matter any other programming language. And the best part of it, the same person who happens to be an expert in <strong>Perl</strong>, goes on and do it <strong>20+ different languages</strong> as well. Then there is this guy who is very famous for his <strong>Raku</strong> skill, suddenly decided to share solutions in <strong>Perl</strong> as well. How cool it is? This is something you wouldn't have imagine 2 years ago.</p>

<p>Let me share my own story, few years ago at the <strong>London Perl Workshop</strong> event, I was gifted a book on <strong>Raku</strong> for my contributions to <strong>CPAN</strong>. For the next one year, I didn't get chance to read even a single page. Then came the weekly challenge where I got the opportunity to see the work of many <strong>Raku</strong> experts. I was inspired by each one of them and decided to get my hand dirty too. As of today, I contributed <strong>73 Perl</strong> solutions and <strong>67 Raku</strong> solutions. Not a bad stats for a first timer.</p>

<p>Generally <strong>Perl</strong> and <strong>Raku</strong> are the two most popular languages the weekly challenge rely on but that doesn't stop members trying different languages every week. As of today, we have received solutions in <strong>60+ different languages</strong> other than <strong>Perl</strong> and <strong>Raku</strong>. Any guess who tops the list? Well, it is none other than <strong>Python</strong>. I have recently started learning <strong>Python</strong>. Soon I would be contributing in <strong>Python</strong> too. Since the tag line of the weekly challenge is <em><strong>"You don't have to be an expert"</strong></em>, as soon as I feel little comfortable I am going to jump straight away. There is no harm, since nobody is going to judge me here and one day I can be as good as I am in <strong>Perl</strong> today.</p>

<p>It is no longer secret any more, most of my spare time is devoted to the weekly challenge management. It is a tough job and at times, I feel really tired. In the recent weeks, I purposely stayed away for few days without doing any work on the weekly challenge. In the end, I felt bad for not doing anything. I then clear the entire backlog in one sitting. I play with my emotions at times and it is fun. When I am not doing anything serious, I spend time looking at the various <a href="https://perlweeklychallenge.org/chart">charts</a>. It tells me so many interesting stories every time I look at it. For example, if you look at the Leaders board, there is a story behind every names.</p>

<p><strong>Do you think the weekly challenge is the only thing that keeps me busy all the time?</strong></p>

<p>The short answer is <strong>No</strong>. I also take part in the monthly event <strong>"Pull Request Club"</strong>. Submitting <strong>Pull Request</strong> was my hobby before the weekly challenge took over and left no time for anything else. Thanks to the monthly nature of the event, I have successfully managed it till date since the beginning without missing a single month. And when I receive the response like below, do you think I am going to stop any time sooner?</p>

<p>There is another surprise celebration that I am desperate to share with you all but I can't go public unless all the paper work done. I hope to get it done by end of next week. Unfortunately you all have to wait for the next monthly report that is when I will share the surprise with you all.</p>

        <![CDATA[<p>As most of you are probably aware,
Kent Fredric sadly passed away earlier this year:
<a href="https://www.facebook.com/kent.fredric/posts/10158837806906830">notice from his family, on Facebook</a>.</p>

<p>Kent was a prolific contributor to CPAN and Perl.
He released more than 150 distributions of his own to CPAN,
but also helped countless other authors and distributions,
with bug reports, puil requests, and more.</p>

<p>When a CPAN author dies,
their indexing permissions are dropped from PAUSE,
and where they had the first-come permission,
that will be passed to the pseudo-user ADOPTME.
This flags the distribution as being available for adoption.</p>

<p>So as of now, all of Kent's distributions are available for adoption.</p>
]]>
        <![CDATA[<p>If you look at <a href="https://metacpan.org/author/KENTNL">Kent's author page</a> on MetaCPAN, you'll see 178 distributions (at the time of writing). This means that he was the last person to release those distributions, but in a few cases he didn't have the first-come permission.</p>

<p>When you look at his author page on MetaCPAN, notice the leftmost column, with the blue bars. The bars are an indication of the distribution's position on the <a href="https://neilb.org/2015/04/20/river-of-cpan.html">CPAN River</a> &mdash; a measure of how many other CPAN distributions use that distribution. The more bars, the more dependent distributions. If you hover your mouse pointer over the bars, you'll see the number of dependents.</p>

<p>As you can see, many of Kent's distributions are relied on by other CPAN distributions, and in some cases by thousands. As a result, the PAUSE admins will consider adoption requests carefully, and try to ensure that such distributions are passed into safe hands.</p>

<h2>How does adoption work?</h2>

<p>When you release a new module, PAUSE assigns you the <strong>first-come</strong> indexing permission for the module. This means that your releases of the module will be considered for inclusion in the CPAN Index, and also that you can give other people the <strong>co-maint</strong> indexing permission. People with co-maint can do releases, but they can't grant co-maint to others. For more on indexing permissions, see the <a href="https://github.com/andk/pause/blob/master/doc/operating-model.md#3-indexing-permissions">relevant section</a> in the <a href="https://github.com/andk/pause/blob/master/doc/operating-model.md">PAUSE Operating Model</a>.</p>

<p>If you want to contribute to someone else's distribution, and do releases of it, then the usual model is that you talk to the person who has the first-come indexing permission, and they'll give you co-maint. You haven't adopted the distribution, you became a contributor.</p>

<p>Adoption of a distribution is the process of being given the first-come indexing permission on all modules in the distribution. Most of the time it is the current maintainer (the person with first-come) who transfers the indexing permissions, but in special circumstances, the PAUSE admins can do this.</p>

<h2>If you want to adopt one of Kent's distributions</h2>

<p>If you want to adopt a distribution, please email the PAUSE admins (modules at perl dor org), and make your case.</p>

<p>If it's a distribution that doesn't have any dependents, then you just need to explain your interest, and demonstrate that you have experience as a CPAN author.</p>

<p>The further up the CPAN River the distribution is, though, the stronger your case will need to be: you should have experience maintaining similar modules, both in terms of dependencies, and the type of module. If your existing distributions are tier 0 or tier 1 (either no blue bars or 1), then you'd have to make a strong case for anything above tier 3.</p>

<p>Here are the sorts of things we'd expect from a tier 3+ author:</p>

<ul>
<li>A good test suite, with attention paid to coverage.</li>
<li>Pays attention to CPAN Testers, and has a suitably green <a href="http://matrix.cpantesters.org/?dist=MIME-Base64">matrix</a>.</li>
<li>Does developer releases to check relevant changes across versions of Perl and different operating systems.</li>
<li>Pays attention to the dependency graph of their distributions (not only the modules that you use directly, but the modules that they use, and so on).</li>
<li>Adheres to CPAN conventions for a well-formed release.</li>
<li>Considers the minimum version of Perl that the distribution should support, and doesn't radically change this overnight.</li>
<li>Pays attention to copyright and licensing.</li>
<li>Thorough documentation, with a SEE ALSO referencing other relevant modules.</li>
<li>Is respectful of contributors, users, competing modules and their authors, and the general Perl community.</li>
</ul>

<p>A more thorough discussion of this topic can be found in Tux's <a href="https://github.com/Tux/Release-Checklist/blob/master/Checklist.md">release checklist</a>.</p>

<p>This is not meant to discourage you from adopting a distribution, rather to encourage you to step up, but not to overreach. If the prospect of adopting a distribution terrifies you with the prospect of breaking half of CPAN, it's probably not the right one for you. At least for now.</p>

<p>If you have used one or more of Kent's distributions,
maybe you could consider adopting one of them,
to keep it maintained going forward.
It's a great way to give back to the Perl community.</p>

<p>If you don't already have a PAUSE account,
maybe this is a good time to <a href="https://pause.perl.org/pause/query?ACTION=request_id">sign up for one</a>?</p>

  List outdated modules &lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can use &lt;a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/distribution/cpan-outdated/script/cpan-outdated"&gt;cpan-outdated&lt;/a&gt; to get the list of your outdated modules.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;cpan-outdated &lt;span class="nt"&gt;-p&lt;/span&gt;
Acme::Automatix
Alien::Plotly::Orca
Alien::SNMP::MAXTC
PPIx::QuoteLike
PPIx::Regexp
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Outdated modules you said?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The discrepancy is totally normal, since modules versions evolve on CPAN but not necessarily locally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my example, the list is very small because I updated all my modules very recently with &lt;code&gt;cpan-outdated -p | cpanm&lt;/code&gt; (I don't really know why I did it but it was cool 😀).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#get-latest-changes" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Get latest changes &lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Use &lt;a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/distribution/cpan-listchanges/script/cpan-listchanges"&gt;cpan-listchanges&lt;/a&gt; to get meaningful portions of changelog between the version installed locally versus the latest version on CPAN. Example with one of the outdated from my previous list:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;cpan-listchanges PPIx::QuoteLike
&lt;span class="o"&gt;===&lt;/span&gt; Changes between 0.015 and 0.016 &lt;span class="k"&gt;for &lt;/span&gt;PPIx-QuoteLike

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You can also see the JSON::Conditional deps (here for perl 5.26.1) on &lt;a href="http://deps.cpantesters.org/?module=JSON%3A%3AConditional&amp;amp;perl=5.26.1&amp;amp;os=any+OS"&gt;deps.cpantester.org&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or a nice view (configurable) on &lt;a href="https://cpandeps.grinnz.com/?dist=JSON-Conditional&amp;amp;dist_version=&amp;amp;phase=test&amp;amp;recommends=1&amp;amp;suggests=1&amp;amp;perl_version=v5.26.1&amp;amp;style=auto"&gt;cpandeps.grinnz.com&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;None of these 2 pages give the exact same result than the command line, I haven't checked why, we could discuss in comments (maybe something with dynamic/static).&lt;/p&gt;

  List system requirements &lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several modules require libraries or development kit that CPAN can't satisfy (even if &lt;a href="https://alienfile.org/"&gt;Alien modules&lt;/a&gt; can often fill this gap). Having a CPAN module installation failing because a dependency is missing is "normal". It is like when you compile something, it fails while reporting a missing header because you need to install it before. To help you and automatic tests, &lt;a href="https://metacpan.org/author/SREZIC"&gt;Slaven Rezić&lt;/a&gt; gathered system dependencies for us in the tool &lt;a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/distribution/CPAN-Plugin-Sysdeps/script/cpan-sysdeps"&gt;cpan-sysdeps&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;cpan-sysdeps &lt;span class="nt"&gt;--cpanmod&lt;/span&gt; Imager
libfreetype6-dev
libgif-dev
libpng-dev
libjpeg-dev
libtiff5-dev
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I was mad when I discovered this module, come on MetaCPAN and hit the "++" button!&lt;/p&gt;

  Basic CPAN Tooling
</h1>

<p>When releasing a distribution on <a href="https://www.cpan.org/">CPAN</a>, authors need to include an installer script. Classically, this would be a <code>Makefile.PL</code> using <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/ExtUtils::MakeMaker">ExtUtils::MakeMaker</a> to generate a <code>Makefile</code>, which would then be used with <code>make</code>. Later, <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Module::Build">Module::Build</a> was created, using a <code>Build.PL</code> script which served a similar purpose. The installer script would include information about the distribution, such as the name and prerequisites. This script, as well as the information inside it, would be used by a tool like <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/CPAN">CPAN.pm</a> or <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/cpanm">cpanm</a> to install the distribution and its prerequisites. This is the primary purpose of the tools, as something users interact with to test and install modules.</p>

<p>But since authors always had the install tool at hand, it became a convenient place to put author tools as well. The primary of these would be <code>make dist</code> which generates a distribution archive suitable for uploading to <a href="https://www.cpan.org/">CPAN</a>. For a long time, this was the primary way authors would create releases.</p>

<p>However, as an author tool, <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/ExtUtils::MakeMaker">ExtUtils::MakeMaker</a> leaves a lot to be desired. It uses a <code>MANIFEST</code> file to list the files to include in the distribution, which won't include new files unless the author remembers to run <code>make manifest</code>. And there are other sanity checks that authors should do before making a release that it doesn't provide for at all. Bumping version numbers, updating change logs, tagging and pushing to a VCS server. Some authors would build these tools into their <code>Makefile.PL</code> script, but that can become a maintenance burden. Other tools, like <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Module::Install">Module::Install</a> were created to address some of this, by having a split between the author tools and user code, but it made some other problematic architectural choices.</p>

<h1>
  <a href="#distzilla" class="anchor">
  </a>
  Dist::Zilla
</h1>

<p>These issues led to the creation of tools like <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Dist::Zilla">Dist::Zilla</a> which entirely separate the author tooling from the user tooling. It would also take over writing the <code>Makefile.PL</code> script, since writing a proper <code>Makefile.PL</code> is not trivial, and being able to include arbitrary code is usually unneeded. It is based on a plugin system, allowing authors to tailor its behavior to whatever release process they prefer.</p>

<p><a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Dist::Zilla">Dist::Zilla</a> can be a fantastic tool, but comes with its own problems. There can be unexpected interactions between the multitude of plugins and versions, which can make the results of builds hard to reproduce without significant effort. It can also be difficult to express the desired build process via the plugin system, or to understand how it will behave by reading its configuration. The combination of these plugins often leads to a significant number of prerequisites, increasing the complexity and avenues of failure. It also regularly gets updated to take advantage of new perl features, which prevents it from being used on older perl versions<sup id="fnref1"><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup>. These issues are all trade-offs made to allow it to be very feature full and extremely flexible.</p>

<h1>
  <a href="#distar" class="anchor">
  </a>
  Distar
</h1>

<p>Not all authors agree with the trade-offs made by tools like <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Dist::Zilla">Dist::Zilla</a>. <a href="https://metacpan.org/author/MSTROUT">Matt S Trout</a> wanted an author tool, but started from a different perspective. What needs to be added on top of what <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/ExtUtils::MakeMaker">ExtUtils::MakeMaker</a> provides to make it a viable author tool? The result of this thought process was <a href="https://github.com/p5sagit/Distar">Distar</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/p5sagit/Distar">Distar</a> is a tool that adds just enough to <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/ExtUtils::MakeMaker">ExtUtils::MakeMaker</a> so you can't bungle a release. And it is small enough to be able to read and understand the entire codebase at the same time.</p>

<p>It uses an allowlist to include files in the dist, rather than <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/ExtUtils::MakeMaker">ExtUtils::MakeMaker</a>'s normal denylist, preventing extraneous files in the working directory from being shipped. It makes certain that the <code>MANIFEST</code> is up to date. It ensures you are testing against the same thing you are releasing. It forces you to add a Changelog entry for your release. It uploads to <a href="https://www.cpan.org/">CPAN</a>, and tags and pushes to git. And it does very little else.</p>

<p>Since its creation, <a href="https://github.com/p5sagit/Distar">Distar</a> has seen very little adoption. The only other <a href="https://www.cpan.org/">CPAN</a> author using it that I'm aware of is me. I've also done most of the development for the last several years, making it more robust, and including a few quality of life improvements like version bumping.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/p5sagit/Distar">Distar</a> does not make any changes from files in the repository vs the files shipped in the distribution. It generates a <code>README</code>, a <code>LICENSE</code> file, and the default files created by <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/ExtUtils::MakeMaker">ExtUtils::MakeMaker</a>, <code>META.json</code> and <code>META.yml</code>.</p>

<h1>
  <a href="#how-does-distar-work" class="anchor">
  </a>
  How Does Distar Work?
</h1>

<p>To use <a href="https://github.com/p5sagit/Distar">Distar</a>, you start with a normal <code>Makefile.PL</code>:</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>use ExtUtils::MakeMaker;
WriteMakefile(NAME =&gt; "My::Cool::Module");
</code></pre>

</div>

<p>Before the call to <code>WriteMakefile</code>, you add:</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>(do './maint/Makefile.PL.include' or die $@) unless -f 'META.yml';
</code></pre>

</div>

<p>Since the <code>META.yml</code> file is generated by <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/ExtUtils::MakeMaker">ExtUtils::MakeMaker</a> in the distribution directory it creates, but not the working directory, it is a reliable check for "author mode" in a pure <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/ExtUtils::MakeMaker">EUMM</a> environment.</p>

<p>You then create the file <code>maint/Makefile.PL.include</code> with the content:</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>BEGIN { -e 'Distar' or system qw(git clone https://github.com/p5sagit/Distar.git) }
use lib 'Distar/lib';
use Distar;

author 'A. U. Thor &lt;author@cpan.org&gt;';
</code></pre>

</div>

<p><a href="https://github.com/p5sagit/Distar">Distar</a> provides essentially no configuration aside from this. Any customization needed in the build process needs to be written in the <code>Makefile.PL</code>, the same way it would be for raw <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/ExtUtils::MakeMaker">ExtUtils::MakeMaker</a>.</p>

<p>To make a release using <a href="https://github.com/p5sagit/Distar">Distar</a>, the process is:</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>make bump           # bump version number
make nextrelease    # add changelog version heading
make release        # test &amp; release
</code></pre>

</div>
<h2>
  <a href="#make-release" class="anchor">
  </a>
  make release
</h2>

<p>The core of <a href="https://github.com/p5sagit/Distar">Distar</a> is the <code>release</code> target. It does a number of sanity checks, then creates a release.</p>

<ul>
<li>Verify that the version numbers in all of the modules are matching.</li>
<li>Verify that the <code>MANIFEST</code> file is up to date.</li>
<li>Verify that <code>cpan-upload</code> is available to push to CPAN.</li>
<li>Fetches any changes from the remote git server</li>
<li>Verify that no git tag exists for the version being published.</li>
<li>Verify that the release is being made from the master branch.</li>
<li>Verify that there are no new commits on the remote git server.</li>
<li>Verify that there is a version line in the Changelog that has been staged in git.</li>
<li>Verify that there are no other uncommitted changes.</li>
<li>Generate a dist directory, including a <code>README</code> and <code>LICENSE</code> file.</li>
<li>Run the tests in the dist directory, with <code>RELEASE_TESTING</code> set.</li>
<li>Create a git commit for the release.</li>
<li>Create a git tag for the release.</li>
<li>Create a dist tarball.</li>
<li>Upload the dist tarball to <a href="https://www.cpan.org/">CPAN</a>.</li>
<li>Push the new tag and commit to the remote git server.</li>
</ul>
<h2>
  <a href="#make-bump" class="anchor">
  </a>
  make bump
</h2>

<p><a href="https://github.com/p5sagit/Distar">Distar</a> provides a version bumping tool to modify any modules or <code>Makefile.PL</code> containing the version number. It is meant to work with both numeric and dotted-decimal style versions. By default, it will bump the last segment of the dotted-decimal version, or the highest precision portion of a numeric version. It also provides other targets to bump specific parts of a version. When bumping a specific part of a version, numeric versions will be treated as <code>X.YYYZZZ</code> versions, the same way perl versions work. Any components following the one specified will be reset to 0.</p>
<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>make bumpmajor                # bump the first digit component
make bumpminor                # bump the second digit component
make bumpbugfix               # bump the third digit component
</code></pre>

</div>

<p>Other options can be used via the <code>V</code> option.</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>make bump V=1.200             # bump to specific version
make bump V=--alpha           # bump last component, but add an underscore
                              # to indicate a developer release
make bump V='major --alpha'   # bump first digit component, but also add
                              # an underscore.
</code></pre>

</div>

<p>After bumping the version, the changes will be committed to git. This will work even if there are other changes in the working directory, leaving those changes uncommitted. The <code>Makefile.PL</code> will then be re-run pick up the new version.</p>

<h2>
  <a href="#make-nextrelease" class="anchor">
  </a>
  make nextrelease
</h2>

<p>The release process of a <a href="https://github.com/p5sagit/Distar">Distar</a> dist requires you to add a version line to your Changelog file, and stage that change (git add). The <code>nextrelease</code> target will do this for you.</p>

<p>It adds the version line, then uses git's interactive add on it, so you will need to confirm the changes. The diff shown should include all of the changelog entries written for the release.</p>

<h1>
  <a href="#git-clone-distar" class="anchor">
  </a>
  git clone Distar
</h1>

<p>The current way <a href="https://github.com/p5sagit/Distar">Distar</a> is distributed is by adding code to <code>Makefile.PL</code> which clones the repository and uses that. Some might think this would present a compatibility or stability issue, but the authors of <a href="https://github.com/p5sagit/Distar">Distar</a> are very committed to maintaining stability and compatibility. Users have to trust that the authors will always keep the code in git in a working state. This trust has been easy to maintain so far, since the known users of <a href="https://github.com/p5sagit/Distar">Distar</a> are its authors.</p>

<p>There may be other users, since its code is small enough that others could understand it without needing any discussion with <a href="https://metacpan.org/author/MSTROUT">Matt S Trout</a> or myself.</p>

<p>Not being published on <a href="https://www.cpan.org/">CPAN</a> limits the visibility of <a href="https://github.com/p5sagit/Distar">Distar</a>. I have, at times, thought of this as a feature. I've been uncertain if I wanted the pressure of additional users, and having to either accomodate or push back against alternate use cases and feature requests.</p>

<h1>
  <a href="#should-you-use-distar" class="anchor">
  </a>
  Should You Use Distar?
</h1>

<p>I have no idea. It works well for me, and fits the model I have for creating releases. It isn't as fully automatic as many <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Dist::Zilla">Dist::Zilla</a> setups are, but it is extremely predictable, backwards compatible, and lightweight. It is very opinionated. It is unlikely to become more configurable to cover differing use cases.</p>

    <title>The Zen of Test Suites</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-zen-of-application-test-suites" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The Zen of Application Test Suites
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a long read, but it's an important one about one of the most common problems I see with my clients: they all have broken test suites. Learning testing is as much a skill as learning coding and this long article only scratches the surface.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much of what I describe below is generic and applies to test suites written in any programming language, despite many examples being written in Perl.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#introduction" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Introduction
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I often speak with developers who take a new job and they describe a Web site built out of a bunch of separate scripts scattered randomly through directories, lots of duplicated code, poor use of modules, with embedded SQL and printing HTTP headers and HTML directly. The developers shake their head in despair, but grudgingly admit an upside: job security. New features are time-consuming to add, changes are difficult to implement and may have wide-ranging side-effects, and reorganizing the codebase to have a proper separation of concerns, to make it cheaper and safer to hack on, will take lots and lots of time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A bunch of randomly scattered scripts, no separation of concerns, lots of duplicated code, poor use of modules, SQL embedded directly in them? Does this sound familiar? It's your standard test suite. We're horrified by this in the code, but don't bat an eyelash at the test suite.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Part of this is because much, if not most, of the testing examples we find focus on testing distributions, not applications. If you were to look at the tests for my module &lt;a href="https://github.com/Ovid/dbix-class-easyfixture"&gt;DBIx::Class::EasyFixture&lt;/a&gt;, you'd see the following tests:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;00-load.t
basic.t
definitions.t
groups.t
load_multiple_fixtures.t
many_to_many.t
no_transactions.t
one_to_many.t
one_to_one.t
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These tests were added one by one, as I added new features to &lt;code&gt;DBIx::Class::EasyFixture&lt;/code&gt; and each &lt;code&gt;*.t&lt;/code&gt; file represents (more or less) a different feature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a small distribution, this isn't too bad because it's very easy to keep it all in your head. With only nine files, it's trivial to glance at them, or grep them, to figure out where the relevant tests are. Applications, however, are a different story. This is the number of test classes from the &lt;a href="https://taustation.space"&gt;Tau Station MMORPG&lt;/a&gt; test suite:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ find t/tests -name '*.pm' | wc -l
589
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One codebase I worked on had close to a million lines of code with thousands of test scripts. You couldn't hold the codebase in your head, you're couldn't &lt;em&gt;glance&lt;/em&gt; at the tests to figure out what went where, nor was grepping necessarily going to tell you as tests for particular sections of code were often scattered around multiple test scripts.  And, of course, I regularly hear the lament I've heard at many shops with larger codebases: where are the tests for feature &lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt;? Instead of just sitting down and writing code, the developers are hunting for the tests, wondering if there are any tests for the feature they're working on and, if not, trying to figure out where to put their new tests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, this disorganization is only the start of the problem.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#largescale-test-suites" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Large-scale test suites
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've worked with many companies with large test suites and they tend to share some common problems. I list them below in the order I try to address these problems (in other words, roughly easiest to hardest).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tests often emit warnings&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tests often fail ("oh, that sometimes fails. Ignore it.")&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is little evidence of organization&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Much of the testing code is duplicated&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Testing fixtures are frequently not used (or poorly used)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Code coverage is spotty&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They take far too long to run&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Problems are one thing, but what features do we want to see in large-scale test suites?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tests should be very easy to write and run&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They should run relatively quickly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The order in which tests run should not matter&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Test output should be clean&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It should be obvious where to find tests for a particular piece of code&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Testing code should not be duplicated&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Code coverage should be able to analyze different aspects of the system&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's take a look at some of the problems and try to understand their impacts.  While it's good to push a test suite into a desirable state, often this is risky if the underlying problems are ignored. I will offer recommendations for resolving each problem, but it's important to understand that these are &lt;em&gt;recommendations&lt;/em&gt;. They may not apply to your situation.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#tests-often-emit-warnings" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Tests often emit warnings
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This seems rather innocuous. Sure, code emits warnings and we're used to that.  Unfortunately, we sometimes forget that warnings are &lt;em&gt;warnings&lt;/em&gt;: there might very well be something wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my time at the BBC, one of the first things I did was try to clean up all of the warnings. One was a normal warning about use of an undefined variable, but it was unclear to me from the code if this should be an acceptable condition. Another developer looked at it with me and realized that the variable should never be undefined: this warning was masking a very serious bug in the code, but the particular condition was not explicitly tested. By rigorously eliminating all warnings, we found it easier to make our code more correct, and in those places where things were dodgy, comments were inserted into the code to explain why warnings were suppressed.  In short: the code became easier to maintain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another issue with warnings in the test suite is that they condition developers to ignore warnings. We get so used to them that we stop reading them, even if something serious is going on (on a related note, I often listen to developers complain about stack traces, but a careful reading of a stack trace will often reveal the exact cause of the exception). New warnings crop up, warnings change, but developers conditioned to ignore them often overlook serious issues with their code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation&lt;/strong&gt;: Eliminate all warnings from your test suite, but investigate each one to understand if it reflects a serious issue. Also, some tests will capture STDERR, effectively hiding warnings. Making warnings fatal while running tests can help to overcome this problem.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#tests-often-fail-oh-that-sometimes-fails-ignore-it" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Tests often fail ("oh, that sometimes fails. Ignore it.")
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For one client, their hour-long test suite had many failing tests. When I first started working on it, I had a developer walk me through all of the failures and explain why they failed and why they were hard to fix. Obviously this is a far more serious problem than warnings, but in the minds of the developers, they were under constant deadline pressures and as far as management was concerned, the test suite was a luxury to keep developers happy, not "serious code." As a result, developers learned to recognize these failures and consoled themselves with the thought that they understood the underlying issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, that's not really how it works. The developer explaining the test failures admitted that he didn't understand some of them and with longer test suites that routinely fail, more failures tend to crop up. Developers conditioned to accept failures tend not to notice them. They kick off the test suite, run and grab some coffee and later glance over the results to see if they look reasonable (that's assuming they run all of the tests, something which often stops happening at this point). What's worse, continuous integration tools are often built to accomodate this. From the Jenkin's &lt;a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/xUnit+Plugin"&gt;xUnit Plugin page&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#features" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Features
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Records xUnit tests&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mark the build unstable or fail according to threshold values&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, there's an "acceptable" level of failure. What's the acceptable level of failure when you debit someone's credit card, or you're sending their medical records to someone, or you're writing embedded software that can't be easily updated?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dogmatism aside, you can make a case for acceptable levels of test failure, but you need to understand the risks and be prepared to accept them. However, for the purposes of this document, we'll assume that the acceptable level of failure is zero.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you absolutely cannot fix a particular failure, you should at least mark the test as &lt;code&gt;TODO&lt;/code&gt; so that the test suite can pass. Not only does this help to guide you to a clean test suite, the &lt;code&gt;TODO&lt;/code&gt; reason is generally embedded in the test, giving the next developer a clue to what's going on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation&lt;/strong&gt;: Do not allow any failing tests. If tests fail which do not impact the correctness of the application (such as documentation or "coding style" tests), they should be separated from your regular tests in some manner and your systems should recognize that it's OK for them to fail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#there-is-little-evidence-of-organization" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  There is little evidence of organization
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As mentioned previously, a common lament amongst developers is the difficulty of finding tests for the code they're working on. Consider the case of &lt;a href="https://metacpan.org/release/HTML-TokeParser-Simple"&gt;HTML::TokeParser::Simple&lt;/a&gt;.  The library is organized like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;lib/
└── HTML
    └── TokeParser
        ├── Simple
        │   ├── Token
        │   │   ├── Comment.pm
        │   │   ├── Declaration.pm
        │   │   ├── ProcessInstruction.pm
        │   │   ├── Tag
        │   │   │   ├── End.pm
        │   │   │   └── Start.pm
        │   │   ├── Tag.pm
        │   │   └── Text.pm
        │   └── Token.pm
        └── Simple.pm
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There's a class in there named &lt;code&gt;HTML::TokeParser::Simple::Token::ProcessInstruction&lt;/code&gt;. Where, in the following tests, would you find the tests for process instructions?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;t
├── constructor.t
├── get_tag.t
├── get_token.t
├── internals.t
└── munge_html.t
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might think it's in the &lt;code&gt;get_token.t&lt;/code&gt; test, but are you sure? And what's that strange &lt;code&gt;munge_html.t&lt;/code&gt; test? Or the &lt;code&gt;internals.t&lt;/code&gt; test? As mentioned, for a small library, this really isn't too bad. However, what if we reorganized our tests to reflect our library hierarchy?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;t/
└── tests/
    └── html/
        └── tokeparser/
            ├── simple/
            │   ├── token/
            │   │   ├── comment.t
            │   │   ├── declaration.t
            │   │   ├── tag/
            │   │   │   ├── end.t
            │   │   │   └── start.t
            │   │   ├── tag.t
            │   │   └── text.t
            │   └── token.t
            └── simple.t
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's clear that the tests for &lt;code&gt;HTML::TokeParser::Simple::Token::Tag::Start&lt;/code&gt; are in &lt;code&gt;t/tests/html/tokeparser/simple/token/tag/start.t&lt;/code&gt;. And you can see easily that there is no file for &lt;code&gt;processinstruction.t&lt;/code&gt;. This test organization not only makes it easy to find where your tests are, it's also easy to program your editor to automatically switch between the code and the tests for the code. For large test suites, this saves a huge amount of time.  When I reorganized the test suite of the BBC's central metadata repository, &lt;a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/bbcinternet/2009/02/what_is_pips.html"&gt;PIPs&lt;/a&gt;, I followed a similar pattern and it made our life much easier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(&lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt;: the comment about programming your editor is important. Effective use of your editor/IDE is one of the most powerful tools in a developer's toolbox.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, your test suite could easily be more complicated and your top-level directories inside of your test directory may be structured differently:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;t
├── unit/
├── integration/
├── api/
└── web/
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation&lt;/strong&gt;: Organize your test files to have a predictable, discoverable structure. The test suite should be much easier to work with.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#much-of-the-testing-code-is-duplicated" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Much of the testing code is duplicated
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We're aghast that people routinely cut-n-paste their application code, but we don't even notice when people do this in their test code. More than once I've worked on a test suite with a significant logic change and I've had to find this duplicated code and either change it many places or try to refactor it so that it's in a single place and then change it. We already know why duplicated code is bad, I'm unsure why we tolerate this in test suites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much of my work in tests has been to reduce this duplication. For example, many test scripts list the same set of modules at the top. I did a heuristic analysis of tests on the CPAN and chose the most popular testing modules and that allowed me to change this:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight perl"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;use&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;strict&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;use&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;warnings&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;use&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;Test::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;Exception&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;use&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;Test::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;Differences&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;use&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;Test::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;Deep&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;use&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;Test::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;Warn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;use&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;Test::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;More&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;tests&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;42&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To this:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight perl"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;use&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;Test::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;Most&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;tests&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;42&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You can easily use similar strategies to bundle up common testing modules into a single testing module that all of your tests use. Less boilerplate and you can easily dive into testing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or as a more egregious example, I often see something like this (a silly example just for illustration purposes):&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight perl"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;set_up_some_data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;my&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$object&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;Object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nv"&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;attr1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$expected1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;attr1 works&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;';&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nv"&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;attr2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$expected2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;attr2 works&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;';&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nv"&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;attr3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$expected3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;attr3 works&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;';&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nv"&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;attr4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$expected4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;attr4 works&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;';&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nv"&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;attr5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$expected5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;attr5 works&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;';&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And then a few lines later:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight perl"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;set_up_some_data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$new_id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;my&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$object&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;Object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$new_id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nv"&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;attr1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$expected1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;attr1 works&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;';&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nv"&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;attr2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$expected2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;attr2 works&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;';&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nv"&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;attr3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$expected3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;attr3 works&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;';&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nv"&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;attr4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$expected4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;attr4 works&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;';&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nv"&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;attr5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$expected5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;attr5 works&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;';&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And then a few lines later, the same thing ...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And in another test file, the same thing ...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Put that in its own test function and wrap those attribute tests in a loop. If this pattern is repeated in different test files, put it in a custom test library:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight perl"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;sub &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;test_fetching_by_id&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;my&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$tests&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;@_&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;my&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$object&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;foreach&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;my&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$test&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;@$tests&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;my&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$attribute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$expected&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;@$test&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nv"&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$attribute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$expected&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; 
          &lt;span class="p"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;$attribute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt; works for &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;$class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;$id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;";&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And then you call it like this:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight perl"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;my&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;@id_tests&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="s"&gt;tests&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;attr1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$expected1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;attr2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$expected2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;attr3&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$expected3&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;attr4&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$expected4&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;attr5&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$expected5&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;]},&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$new_id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="s"&gt;tests&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;attr1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$new_expected1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;attr2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$new_expected2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;attr3&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$new_expected3&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;attr4&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$new_expected4&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;attr5&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$new_expected5&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;]},&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;my&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$test&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;@id_tests&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;){&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nv"&gt;test_fetching_by_id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; 
       &lt;span class="p"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;',&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$test&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$tests&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;test&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This is a cleanly refactored data-driven approach. By not repeating yourself, if you need to test new attributes, you can just add an extra line to the data structures and the code remains the same. Or, if you need to change the logic, you only have one spot in your code where this is done. Once a developer understands the &lt;code&gt;test_fetching_by_id()&lt;/code&gt; function, they can reuse this understanding in multiple places. Further, it makes it easier to find patterns in your code and any competent programmer is always on the lookout for patterns because those are signposts leading to cleaner designs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation&lt;/strong&gt;: Keep your test code as clean as your application code.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#testing-fixtures-are-frequently-not-used-or-poorly-used" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Testing fixtures are frequently not used (or poorly used)
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One difference between your application code and the test suite is in an application, we often have no idea what the data will be and we try to have a clean separation of data and code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In your test suite, we also want a clean separation of data and code (in my experience, this is very hit-or-miss), but we often &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; to know the data we have. We set up data to run tests against to ensure that we can test various conditions. Can we give a customer a birthday discount if they were born on February 29th? Can a customer with an overdue library book check out another?  If our employee number is no longer in the database, is our code properly deleted, along with the backups and the git history erased? (kidding!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we set up the data for these known conditions under which to test, we call the data a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_fixture"&gt;test fixture&lt;/a&gt;.  Test fixtures, when properly designed, allow us generate clean, understandable tests and make it easy to write tests for unusual conditions that may otherwise be hard to analyze.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are several common anti-patterns I see in fixtures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hard to set up and use&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adding them to the database and not rolling them back&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Loading all your test data at once with no granularity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In reviewing various fixture modules on the CPAN and for clients I have worked with, much of the above routinely holds true. On top of that, documentation is often rather sparse or non-existent. Here's a (pseudo-code) example of an almost undocumented fixture system for one client I worked with and it exemplified common issues in this area.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight perl"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;load_fixture&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="s"&gt;database&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;sales&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;',&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="s"&gt;client&lt;/span&gt;   &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$client_id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="s"&gt;datasets&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sx"&gt;qw/customers orders items order_items/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This had several problems, all of which could be easily corrected &lt;em&gt;as code&lt;/em&gt;, but they built a test suite around these problems and had backed themselves into a corner, making their test suite dependent on bad behavior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The business case is that my client had a product serving multiple customers and each customer would have multiple separate databases. In the above, client &lt;em&gt;$client_id&lt;/em&gt; connects to their sales database and we load several test datasets and run tests against them. However, loading of data was not done in a transaction, meaning that there was no isolation between different test cases in the same process. More than once I caught issues where running an individual test case would often fail because it depended on data loaded by a different test case, but it wasn't always clear which test cases were coupled with which.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another issue is that fixtures were not fine-tuned to address particular test cases. Instead, if you loaded "customers" or "referrals", you got &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; of them in the database. Do you need a database with a single customer with a single order and only one order item on it to test that obscure bug that occurs when a client first uses your software? There really wasn't any clean way of doing that; data was loaded in an "all or nothing" context. Even if you violated the paradigm and tried to create fine-tuned fixtures, it was very hard to write them due to the obscure, undocumented format needed to craft the data files for them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because transactions were not used and changes could not be rolled back, each &lt;code&gt;*.t&lt;/code&gt; file would rebuild its own test database, a very slow process. Further, due to lack of documentation about the fixtures, it was often difficult to figure out which combination of fixtures to load to test a given feature. Part of this is simply due to the complex nature of the business rules, but the core issues stemmed from a poor understanding of fixtures. This client now has multiple large, slow test suites, spread across multiple repositories, all of which constantly tear down and set up databases and load large amounts of data. The test suites are both slow and fragile. The time and expense to fix this problem is considerable due to how long they've pushed forward with this substandard setup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What you generally want is the ability to easily create understandable fixtures which are loaded in a transaction, tests are run, and then changes are rolled back.  The fixtures need to be fine-grained so you can tune them for a particular test case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One attempt I've made to fix this situation is releasing &lt;a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/DBIx-Class-EasyFixture/lib/DBIx/Class/EasyFixture.pm"&gt;DBIx::Class::EasyFixture&lt;/a&gt;, along with &lt;a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/DBIx-Class-EasyFixture/lib/DBIx/Class/EasyFixture/Tutorial.pm"&gt;a tutorial&lt;/a&gt;.  It does rely on &lt;code&gt;DBIx::Class&lt;/code&gt;, the most popular ORM for Perl. This will likely make it unsuitable for some use cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using fixtures is now very simple:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight perl"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;my&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$fixtures&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;DBIx::Class::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;EasyFixture&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="s"&gt;schema&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$schema&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$fixtures&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;load&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;('&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;customer_with_order_without_items&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;');&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# run your tests&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For the customer's code, we could satisfy the different database requirements by passing in different schemas. Other (well-documented) solutions, particularly those which are pure &lt;code&gt;DBI&lt;/code&gt; based are welcome in this area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation&lt;/strong&gt;: Use fine-grained, well-documented fixtures which are easy to create and easy to clean up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#code-coverage-is-poorly-understood" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Code coverage is poorly understood
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consider the following code:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;float recip(float number) {
    return 1.0 / number;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And a sample test:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;assert recip(2.0) returns .5;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Congratulations! You now have 100% code coverage of that function.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a statically typed language, I'm probably going to be moderately comfortable with that test. Alas, for dynamically typed languages we're fooling ourselves. An equivalent function in Perl will pass that test if we use &lt;code&gt;recip("2 apples")&lt;/code&gt; as the argument. And what happens if we pass a file handle? And would a Unicode number work? What happens if we pass no arguments?  Perl is powerful and lets us write code quickly, but there's a price: it expects us to know what we're doing and passing unexpected kinds of data is a very common source of errors, but one that 100% code coverage will never (no pun intended) uncover. This can lead to false confidence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To work around false confidence in your code, always assume that you write applications to create things and you write tests to destroy them. Testing is, and should be, an act of violence. If you're not breaking anything with your tests, you're probably doing it wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or what if you have that code in a huge test suite, but it's dead code? We tend to blindly run code coverage over our entire test suite, never considering whether or not we're testing dead code. This is because we slop our unit, integration, API and other tests all together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or consider the following test case:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight perl"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;sub &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;test_forum&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;my&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$test&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;shift&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;my&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$site&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$test&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;test_website&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$site&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;login&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$pass&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$site&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;('&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;/forum&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;');&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$site&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;follow_link&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;text&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Off Topic&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$site&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;post_ok&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="s"&gt;title&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;What is this?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;',&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="s"&gt;body&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;This is a test&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;We should be able to post to the forum&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;');&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Devel::Cover&lt;/code&gt; doesn't know which code is test code and which is not.  &lt;code&gt;Devel::Cover&lt;/code&gt; merely tells you if your application code was exercised in your tests. &lt;a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Devel-Cover/lib/Devel/Cover.pm#UNCOVERABLE_CRITERIA"&gt;You can annotate your code with "uncoverable" directives&lt;/a&gt; to tell &lt;code&gt;Devel::Cover&lt;/code&gt; to ignore the following code, but that potentially means sprinkling your code with annotations all over the place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are multiple strategies to deal with this. One of the simplest is to merely run your code coverage tools over the public-facing portions of your code, such as web or API tests. If you find uncovered code, you either have code that is not fully tested (in the sense that you don't know if your API can really use that code) or, if you cannot write an API test to reach that code, investigate if it is dead code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can do this by grouping your tests into subdirectories:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;t/
|--api/
|--integration/
`--unit/
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, if you use &lt;code&gt;Test::Class::Moose&lt;/code&gt;, you can tag your tests and only run coverage over tests including the tags you wish to test:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;code&gt;perl&lt;br&gt;
My::Test::Class::Moose-&amp;gt;new({&lt;br&gt;
  include_tags =&amp;gt; [qw/api/],&lt;br&gt;
})-&amp;gt;runtests;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you start tagging your tests by the subsystems they are testing, you can then start running code coverage on specific subsystems to determine which ones are poorly tested.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation&lt;/strong&gt;: Run coverage over public-facing code and on different subsystems to find poor coverage.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#they-take-far-too-long-to-run" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  They take far too long to run
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem with long-running test suites is well known, but it's worth covering this again here. These are problems that others have discussed and that I have also personally experienced many times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--XZ02lHaL--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/http://i.imgur.com/JNfyxoo.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--XZ02lHaL--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/http://i.imgur.com/JNfyxoo.png" alt="Perl's version of waiting for a compile"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;With apologies to &lt;a href="http://xkcd.com/303/"&gt;XKCD&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the best case scenario for developers who always run that long-running test suite, expensive developer time is wasted while the test suite is running.  When they launch that hour-long (or more) test suite, they frequently take a break, talk to (read: interrupt) other developers, check their Facebook, or do any number of things which equate to "not writing software." Yes, some of those things involve meetings or research, but meetings don't conveniently schedule themselves when we run tests and for mature products (those which are more likely to have long-running test suites), there's often not that much research we really need to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some of the issues with long-running test suites:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Expensive developer time is wasted while the test suite runs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Developers often don't run the entire test suite&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Expensive code coverage is not generated as a result&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Code is fragile as a result&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I find particularly curious is that we accept this state of affairs. Even a back-of-the-envelope calculation can quickly show significant productivity benefits that will pay off in the long run by taking care of our test suite.  &lt;a href="http://www.slideshare.net/Ovid/turbo-charged-test-suites-presentation"&gt;I once reduced a BBC test suite's run time from one hour and twenty minutes down to twelve minutes&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;Note: today I use a saner approach that results in similar or greater performance benefits&lt;/em&gt;).  We had six developers on that team. When the test suite took over an hour to run, they often didn't run the test suite. They would run tests on their section of code and push their code when they were comfortable with it. This led to other developers finding buggy code and wasting time trying to figure out how they had broken it when, in fact, someone else broke the code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But let's assume each developer was running the test suite at least once a day (I'm careful about testing and often ran mine twice a day). By cutting test suite run time by over an hour, we reclaimed a &lt;em&gt;full day&lt;/em&gt; of developer productivity every day! Even if it takes a developer a month to increase perfomance by that amount it pays for itself many times over very quickly.  Why would you not do this?  As a business owner, wouldn't you want your developers to save time on their test suite so they can create features faster for you?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are several reasons why this is difficult. Tasking a developer with a block of time to speed up a test suite means the developer is not creating user-visible features during that time. For larger test suites, it's often impossible to know in advance just how much time you can save or how long it will take you to reach your goal. In most companies I've worked with, the people who can make the decision to speed up the test suite are often not the people feeling the pain. Productivity and quality decrease slowly over time, leading to the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boiling_frog"&gt;boiling frog problem&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What's worse: in order to speed up your test suite without affecting behavior, the test suite often has to be "fixed" (eliminating warnings, failures, and reducing duplication) to ensure that no behavior has been changed during the refactor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, some developers simply don't have the background necessary to implement performance optimizations. While performance profiles such as Perl's &lt;a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Devel-NYTProf/lib/Devel/NYTProf.pm"&gt;Devel::NYTProf&lt;/a&gt; can easily point out problem areas in the code, it's not always clear how to overcome the discovered limitations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The single biggest factor in poor test suite performance for applications is frequently I/O. In particular, working with the database tends to be a bottleneck and there's only so much database tuning that can be done. After you've profiled your SQL and optimized it, several database-related optimizations which can be considered are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using transactions to clean up your database rather than rebuilding the database&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Only connect to the database once per test suite (hard when you're using a separate process per test file)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you must rebuild the database, maintain a pool of test databases and assign them as needed, rebuilding used ones in the background&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use smaller database fixtures instead of loading everything at once&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After you've done all you can to improve your database access, you may find that your test suite is "fast enough", but if you wish to go further, there are several steps you can take.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#use-testaggregate" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Use Test::Aggregate
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Test-Aggregate/"&gt;Test::Aggregate&lt;/a&gt; can often double the speed of your test suite (I've had it speed up test suites by around 65%). It does this by taking your separate &lt;code&gt;*.t&lt;/code&gt; files and runs them in a single process. Not all tests can be run this way (tests that munge global state without cleaning up are prime examples), but it's the easiest way to get a quick boost to test suite performance.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#aggressively-search-for-and-remove-duplicated-tests" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Aggressively search for and remove duplicated tests.
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For poorly organized test suites, developers sometimes make the mistake of putting tests for something in a new &lt;code&gt;*.t&lt;/code&gt; file or add them to a different &lt;code&gt;*.t&lt;/code&gt; file, even if related tests already exist. This strategy can be time-consuming and often does not result in quick wins.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#run-performance-profiling" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Run Performance Profiling
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For one test suite, I found that we were using a pure Perl implementation of JSON. As the test suite used JSON extensively, switching to &lt;a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/JSON-XS/XS.pm"&gt;JSON::XS&lt;/a&gt; gave us a nice performance boost. We may not have noticed that if we hadn't been profiling our code with &lt;code&gt;Devel::NYTProf&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#look-for-code-with-global-effects" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Look for code with "global" effects
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On one test suite, I ensured that &lt;code&gt;Universal::isa&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Universal::can&lt;/code&gt; cannot be loaded. It was a quick fix and sped up the test suite by 2% (several small accumulations of improvements can add up quickly).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#inline-hot-functions" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Inline "hot" functions.
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consider the following code which runs in about 3.2 seconds on my computer:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;`&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight perl"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;#!/usr/bin/env perl&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;use&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;strict&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;use&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;warnings&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nb"&gt;no&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;warnings&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;recursion&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;';&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;my&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;..&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;40&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;my&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$j&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;..&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;**&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;my&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$y&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;factorial&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$j&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;sub &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;factorial&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;my&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$num&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;shift&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$num&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$num&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;factorial&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$num&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
`&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By rewriting the recursive function as a loop, the code takes about .87 seconds:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;`&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight perl"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;sub &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;factorial&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;my&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$num&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;shift&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$num&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$num&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="vg"&gt;$_&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;..&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$num&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$num&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
`&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By inlining the calculation, the code completes in .69 seconds:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;`&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight perl"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;my&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;..&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;40&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;my&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$j&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;..&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;**&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;my&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$y&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$j&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$y&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$y&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="vg"&gt;$_&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;..&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$y&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
`&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, in our trivial example, the inlined behavior is roughly 20% faster than the iterative function and 80% faster than the recursive function.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#recompile-your-perl" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Recompile your Perl
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may wish to recompile your Perl to gain a performance improvement. Many Linux distributions ship with a threaded Perl by default. Depending on the version of Perl you ship with, you can gain performance improvements of up to 30% by recompiling without threads. Of course, if you use threads, you'll feel very stupid for doing this. However, if you don't make heavy use of threads, switching to a forking model for the threaded code may make the recompile worth it. Naturally, you'll need to heavily benchmark your code (preferably under production-like loads) to understand the trade-offs here.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#preload-modules" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Preload modules
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your codebase makes heavy use of modules that are slow to load, such as &lt;code&gt;Moose&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Catalyst&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;DBIx::Class&lt;/code&gt; and others, preloading them might help.  &lt;a href="http://search.cpan.org/~miyagawa/forkprove-v0.4.9/script/forkprove"&gt;forkprove&lt;/a&gt; is a utility written by Tatsuhiko Miyagawa that allows you to preload slow-loading modules and then forks off multiple processes to run your tests.  Using this tool, &lt;a href="http://blogs.perl.org/users/ovid/2013/12/merry-christmas-parallel-testing-with-testclassmoose-has-arrived.html"&gt;I reduced one sample test suite's run time from 12 minutes to about a minute&lt;/a&gt;.  Unfortunately, &lt;code&gt;forkprove&lt;/code&gt; doesn't allow schedules, a key component often needed for larger test suites. I'll explain that in the next section.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#parallel-tests" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Parallel tests
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Running tests in parallel is tricky. Some tests simply &lt;em&gt;can't&lt;/em&gt; be run with other tests. Usually these are tests which alter global state in some manner that other processes will pick up, or might cause resource starvation of some kind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or some tests &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; be run in parallel with other tests, but if several tests are updating the same records in the database at the same time, locking behavior might slow down the tests considerably.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or maybe you're running 4 jobs, but all of your slowest tests are grouped in the same job: not good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To deal with this, you can create a schedule that assigns different tests to different jobs, based on a set of criteria, and then puts tests which cannot run in parallel in a single job that runs after the others have completed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can use &lt;a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Test-Harness/lib/TAP/Parser/Scheduler.pm"&gt;TAP::Parser::Scheduler&lt;/a&gt; to create an effective parallel testing setup. You can use this with &lt;code&gt;TAP::Parser::Multiplexer&lt;/code&gt; to create your parallel tests. Unfortunately, as of this writing there's a bug in the Multiplexer whereby it uses &lt;code&gt;select&lt;/code&gt; in a loop to read the parser output. If one parser blocks, none of the other output is read. Further, the schedule must be created prior to loading your test code, meaning that if your tests would prefer a different schedule, you're out of luck. Also, &lt;code&gt;make test&lt;/code&gt; currently doesn't handle this well. There is work being done by David Golden to alleviate this problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My preferred solution is to use &lt;a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Test-Class-Moose/"&gt;Test::Class::Moose&lt;/a&gt;. It has built-in parallel testing and writing schedules is very easy. Further, different test cases can simply use a &lt;code&gt;Tags(noparallel)&lt;/code&gt; attribute to ensure that they're run sequentially after the parallel tests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aside from the regular benefits of &lt;code&gt;Test::Class::Moose&lt;/code&gt;, an interesting benefit of this module is that it loads all of your test and application code into a single process and &lt;em&gt;then&lt;/em&gt; forks off subprocesses. As a result, your code is loaded once and only once. Alternate strategies which try to fork before loading your code might still cause the code to be loaded multiple times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have used this strategy to reduce a &lt;a href="http://blogs.perl.org/users/ovid/2013/12/merry-christmas-parallel-testing-with-testclassmoose-has-arrived.html"&gt;12 minute test suite to 30 seconds&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#distributed-tests" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Distributed tests
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though I haven't used this module, Alex Vandiver has written &lt;a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/TAP-Harness-Remote/lib/TAP/Harness/Remote.pm"&gt;TAP::Harness::Remote&lt;/a&gt;.  This module allows you to rsync directory trees to multiple servers and run tests on those servers. Obviously, this requires multiple servers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to roll your own version of this, I've also released &lt;a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/TAP-Stream/"&gt;TAP::Stream&lt;/a&gt;, a module that allows you to take streams (the text, actually) of TAP from multiple sources and combine them into a single TAP document.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#develcoverxcovered" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Devel::CoverX::Covered
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is yet another interesting strategy: only run tests that exercise the code that you're changing. Johan Lindström wrote &lt;a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Devel-CoverX-Covered/"&gt;Devel::CoverX::Covered&lt;/a&gt;.  This module is used in conjunction with Paul Johnson's &lt;a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Devel-Cover/"&gt;Devel::Cover&lt;/a&gt; to identify all the places in your tests which cover a particular piece of code. In the past, I've written tools for vim to read this data and only run relevant tests. This is a generally useful approach, but there are a couple of pitfalls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, if your test suite takes a long time to run, it will take much, much longer to run with &lt;code&gt;Devel::Cover&lt;/code&gt;. As a result, I recommend that this be used with a special nightly "cover build" and have the results synched back to the developers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, when changing code, it's easy to change which tests cover your code, leading to times when this technique won't cover your actual changes thoroughly. In practice, this hasn't been a problem for me, but I've not used it enough to say that with confidence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation&lt;/strong&gt;: Don't settle for slow test suites. Pick a goal and work to achieving that goal (it's easy to keep optimizing for too long and start getting diminishing marginal returns).&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#testclassmoose" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://github.com/houseabsolute/test-class-moose"&gt;Test::Class::Moose&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you start creating a large Web site, do you start writing a bunch of individual scripts, each designed to handle one URL and each handling their own database access and printing their output directly to STDOUT? Of course not. Today, professional developers reach for Sinatra, Seaside, Catalyst, Ruby on Rails or other Web frameworks. They take a bit more time to set up and configure, but we know they generally save more time in the long run. Why wouldn't you do that with your test suite?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you're using Perl, many of the problems listed in this document can be avoided by switching to &lt;code&gt;Test::Class::Moose&lt;/code&gt;. This is a testing framework I designed to make it very easy to test applications. Once you understand it, it's actually easy to use for testing libraries, but it really shines for application testing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that I now regret putting &lt;code&gt;Moose&lt;/code&gt; in the name. &lt;code&gt;Test::Class::Moose&lt;/code&gt; is a rewrite of &lt;code&gt;Test::Class&lt;/code&gt; using &lt;code&gt;Moose&lt;/code&gt;, but it's &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; limited to testing &lt;code&gt;Moose&lt;/code&gt; applications. It uses &lt;code&gt;Moose&lt;/code&gt; because internally it relies on the &lt;code&gt;Moose&lt;/code&gt; meta-object protocol for introspection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Out of the box you get:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reporting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Parallel tests (which optionally accept a custom schedule)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tagging tests (slice and dice your test suite!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Test inheritance (xUnit for the win!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Full Moose support&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Test control methods (startup, setup, teardown, shutdown)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Extensibility&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All the testing functions and behavior from &lt;code&gt;Test::Most&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To learn about xUnit testing in Perl, you may wish to read a five-part tutorial I published at Modern Perl Books:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.modernperlbooks.com/mt/2009/03/organizing-test-suites-with-testclass.html"&gt;Organizing test suites with Test::Class&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.modernperlbooks.com/mt/2009/03/reusing-test-code-with-testclass.html"&gt;Reusing test code&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.modernperlbooks.com/mt/2009/03/making-your-testing-life-easier.html"&gt;Making your testing life easier&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.modernperlbooks.com/mt/2009/03/using-test-control-methods-with-testclass.html"&gt;Using test control methods&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.modernperlbooks.com/mt/2009/03/working-with-testclass-test-suites.html"&gt;Working with Test::Class test suites&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That tutorial is slightly out of date (I wrote it in 2009), but it explains effective use of &lt;code&gt;Test::Class&lt;/code&gt; and some common anti-patterns when using it.&lt;/p&gt;

        <![CDATA[<p>Many people already have codes like</p>

<pre>
use strict;
use warnings;
</pre>

<p>and so on at the top of each script they write. For scripts which I don't intend to publish anywhere, I have a module (which I accidentally called Z not knowing there was already a module of the same name on CPAN), which switches on lots of things at once just by saying</p>

<pre>
use Z;
</pre>

<p>The top bit goes like this:</p>

<pre>
package Z;
use warnings;
use strict;
use utf8;

use Carp;
use Deploy 'do_system';
use File::Slurper qw!read_text write_text read_lines!;
use FindBin '$Bin';
use Getopt::Long;
use Table::Readable ':all';
use v5.32;
no warnings qw(experimental::signatures);
use feature qw(signatures);
</pre>

<p>So far that is all fairly standard stuff, but what Z does is also to import all of the above things into my script using the <code>EXPORT</code> variables from the above modules:</p>

<pre>
our $VERSION = '0.01';

require Exporter;
our @ISA = qw(Exporter);

our @EXPORT = (
    @Carp::EXPORT,
    @Deploy::EXPORT_OK,
    @File::Slurper::EXPORT_OK,
    @FindBin::EXPORT_OK,
    @Getopt::Long::EXPORT,
    @Table::Readable::EXPORT_OK,
);
</pre>

<p>This requires a special <code>import</code> method:</p>

<pre>
sub import
{
    my ($class) = @_;

    strict->import ();
    utf8->import ();
    warnings->import ();
    warnings->unimport (qw(experimental::signatures));
    feature->import ('signatures');

    Carp->import ();
    File::Slurper->import (qw!read_text write_text!);
    FindBin->import ('$Bin');
    Getopt::Long->import ();
    Deploy->import ('do_system');
    Table::Readable->import (':all');

    Z->export_to_level (1);
}
</pre>

<p>To save another bit of boilerplate I also have</p>

<pre>
binmode STDOUT, ":encoding(utf8)";
</pre>

<p>at the end of the module.</p>

<p>This is for personal convenience so it's not something I would use publicly, but perhaps people who want to save themselves a bit of boilerplate might find this useful for making their own "personal module".</p>

        <![CDATA[<p>During the last years it became fashionable to rag on object oriented programming and a decade ago I would join the choir. Hack, when I started with Perl I despised the bloat and inefficiency of many corporate smelling *coughjava* systems and preached the light weight and foreward thinking way that real hackers travel. In this miniseries I want to write why I changed my tune [part one], the best way (IMO) to use OOP [part two] and why inheritance (incl. roles and templates) and delegation or not helpful features (in contrast to polymorphism) [part three]. Maybe there will be more  about rating Perl OO features and modules.</p>]]>
        <![CDATA[<p>Objects are a tool to create abstraction layer - to do anything. It's easy to get overwhelmed by possibilities or run with preconceived ideas. And the larger the system, the harder it is to make wise choices. I think this is one reason why a lot of OO code sucks. The second is bad coding styles. It's not getting taught enough how to find the right abstractions and how to ease the use by proper naming. The third reason is the introduction and teaching of contra-productive features like inheritance and even worse, multiple inheritance.</p>

<p>So why even bother? To make my point lets unwind history a little. Because back in the days a similar discussion ensued about subroutines, which are also a tool to hide complexity behind a meaningful names. </p>

<p>register_customer( $paul ) is much nicer to our intuitive mind than GOTO 230. It frees up mental resources and makes programming easier. And yes there are 0.2% of algorithms that can be written clearer with goto's (inside a subroutine). Were talking here about API design.</p>

<p>The main point is that we are sealing a sub as one unit to be called or not. Rather than jumping with GOTO into the middle of a sub you insert an additional IF statement inside the sub, to have the option to skip a few lines. Old school programmers may yell at you for wasting 5 or 20 bytes. But you gained the peace knowing the sub always starts at line one so when you approach line 20 you know the data is checked and sanitized so only errors might happen you did not thought about yet. If you jump to line 20 of the sub  with bad data it might be go well for a while and when things go down its hard to find out why. Having a regulated control flow means also have well defined data, which  is the next big win usinf a sub. </p>

<p>And coincidental but not identical with sub : scopes. Create local variables inside a sub to prevent name collisions with other vars with same name and therefore  spooky actions at distance. Its a whole class of problems you instantly can stop to worry and it has no down sides, since you don't want to use the local variables anywhere else anyway. (I only miss the feature that functions can't access anything but their args).</p>

<p>To summarize: scopes - good, routine syntax - helpful and already it is as much about the (regulated state of) data than flow control.<br />
 <br />
Once you get a lot of subs, you prevent name collisions with name spaces (packages), that also give you order so that each sub is in the right place in the hierarchy. But when the namespaces get nested and names becoming longer you start to whish for classes, so you can call the method directly on the object - but were not there yet. Also, attribute data is sanitized once, when coming via a setter into the object and can be used over and over without any second check. So you can pass the object into a sub and data can be used without check, which makes for more efficient code (huh, efficient and oop in same sentnce?). This advantage would vanish if you could reach into object internals, when not having no real encapsulation like in vanilla p5 - but still this is not my main two points.</p>

<p>With the ability to capsule data you can guarantee to oblige to contracts, since noone else touched the data than the little code you have inside you small class. (I already touched on that.).  Most importantly strict abstraction layer walls will tell you if your abstraction layers are appropriate. You will notice it if there is a need to violate them or if your classes or methods get to big. These are clear signs that code has to be refactored. And if you have to many classes, it is a sign you don't have enough high order classes. OOP can be used in a very functional manner which is often less painful (in larger projects) than being strictly  functional and fighting with the strict rules of monads all the time. But how exactly do that will be content of the next part ....</p>]]>

    <title>Interview: Trying to Catch Paul "LeoNerd" Evans</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://perl.com/article/interview-trying-to-catch-paul-leonerd-evans/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.leonerd.org.uk/"&gt;Paul &amp;ldquo;LeoNerd&amp;rdquo; Evans&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; is a
&lt;a href="https://metacpan.org/author/PEVANS"&gt;CPAN author&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href="https://leonerds-code.blogspot.com/"&gt;blogger&lt;/a&gt;,
and &lt;a href="https://github.com/leonerd"&gt;core Perl contributor&lt;/a&gt;. He introduced the
&lt;a href="https://perldoc.perl.org/perlop#Class-Instance-Operator"&gt;experimental &lt;code&gt;isa&lt;/code&gt; operator&lt;/a&gt;
in Perl 5.32 and the &lt;code&gt;try&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;catch&lt;/code&gt; syntax in an upcoming version.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="tell-me-a-little-about-yourself-and-your-background-whatever-you-feel-comfortable-sharing"&gt;Tell me a little about yourself and your background; whatever you feel comfortable sharing.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lets see—I&amp;rsquo;m going to do this in reverse chronological order.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently I&amp;rsquo;m a self-employed contractor, splitting my time between Perl and other computery things, and electronics. Most of the jobs I&amp;rsquo;ve had before I did that were based on Perl, with the minor exception of a little Internet startup company called &amp;ldquo;Google&amp;rdquo;—
maybe you&amp;rsquo;ve heard of them? Sadly they don&amp;rsquo;t do much Perl there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="how-did-you-first-get-into-programming-perl-and-then-later-hacking-on-perl-s-core"&gt;How did you first get into programming Perl, and then later hacking on Perl&amp;rsquo;s core?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I dabbled in a little amount of it at university, during my final year. When I ought to have been studying type systems and other academic stuff I found it much more interesting to be hacking on bits of C and Perl instead, much to the dismay of my supervisors. My first post-study job happened to be in Perl and I&amp;rsquo;ve just stuck with it ever since.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The core hacking all came as a slow progression from writing Perl code, to writing modules, to the inevitable having to write bits of &lt;a href="https://perldoc.perl.org/perlxs"&gt;XS code&lt;/a&gt; for some of those modules. The deeper you dive into that area the more you find you have to understand how the internals of the interpreter work. The largest amount of time I spent on that was probably while making the &lt;a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Future::AsyncAwait"&gt;Future::AsyncAwait&lt;/a&gt; module—that has to have quite a tight in-depth integration with the interpreter core, in order to successfully suspend and resume running functions, which is the basis of how the &lt;code&gt;async&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;await&lt;/code&gt; syntax all works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="you-first-uploaded-the-syntax-keyword-try-module-to-cpan-in-2016-and-at-the-time-there-were-and-are-still-a-number-of-other-modules-with-similar-functionality-you-compared-their-differences-in-the-syntax-keyword-try-documentation-but-were-there-any-particular-issues-that-inspired-you-to-contribute-another-module"&gt;You first uploaded the Syntax::Keyword::Try module to CPAN in 2016, and at the time there were (and are still) a number of other modules with similar functionality. You compared their differences in the Syntax::Keyword::Try documentation, but were there any particular issues that inspired you to contribute another module?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two reasons. The first reason I wrote it just for myself, was a learning exercise to see if I could understand and use this new-fangled &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href="https://perldoc.perl.org/perlapi#wrap_keyword_plugin"&gt;custom keyword&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo; mechanism that was recently added to Perl. Once I had a proof-of-concept working, it didn&amp;rsquo;t take me long to work out how to write it &amp;ldquo;correctly&amp;rdquo;—in the sense that the body of the &lt;code&gt;try&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;catch&lt;/code&gt; blocks were true blocks, and not closures-in-disguise like all of the pure Perl and even all of the custom syntax modules at the time were all doing. This meant it had a much ligher calling overhead, doesn&amp;rsquo;t interact with &lt;code&gt;@_&lt;/code&gt;, plays nicer with &lt;code&gt;return&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;next&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;last&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;redo&lt;/code&gt;, and all sorts of other advantages. From there it didn&amp;rsquo;t take me too long before I had something that I felt had real technical advantages than anything else that came before, so I tried to encourage its use. &lt;a href="irc://irc.freenode.org/perl"&gt;Freenode&amp;rsquo;s #perl channel&lt;/a&gt; in particular were very instrumental in helping that effort, adopting it in their recommendations to new users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="recently-you-ve-spearheaded-adding-native-try-catch-syntax-to-native-perl-and-released-the-feature-compat-try-module-to-offer-the-same-syntax-for-earlier-versions-currently-the-former-is-enabled-by-a-feature-guard-do-you-anticipate-a-time-when-this-will-no-longer-be-the-case-would-that-cause-issues-with-code-that-uses-other-try-catch-syntax-modules"&gt;Recently you&amp;rsquo;ve spearheaded adding native try/catch syntax to native Perl, and released the Feature::Compat::Try module to offer the same syntax for earlier versions. Currently the former is enabled by a feature guard; do you anticipate a time when this will no longer be the case? Would that cause issues with code that uses other try/catch syntax modules?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think it will be quite a while yet before we can see a Perl that would enable it &lt;em&gt;by default&lt;/em&gt;, but I hope very soon it will make its way into the numbered version bundles. That is, I hope that simply&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"&gt;&lt;code class="language-perl" data-lang="perl"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef"&gt;use&lt;/span&gt; v5&lt;span style="color:#ae81ff"&gt;.36&lt;/span&gt;;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;would be enough to enable the &lt;code&gt;try&lt;/code&gt; syntax, and if and when such a time comes that we decide to bump the major version to 7, that will continue to hold—merely saying&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"&gt;&lt;code class="language-perl" data-lang="perl"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef"&gt;use&lt;/span&gt; v7;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;would be sufficient to get that—along with all the other fancy fun things I hope to see by that time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="how-do-you-envision-syntax-keyword-try-s-role-going-forward-will-it-be-a-testbed-for-future-native-perl-exception-features"&gt;How do you envision Syntax::Keyword::Try&amp;rsquo;s role going forward? Will it be a testbed for future native Perl exception features?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It already is just that. There are more features in Syntax::Keyword::Try than the &amp;ldquo;minimal viable product&amp;rdquo; part that I ported to core in &lt;a href="https://github.com/Perl/perl5/releases/tag/v5.33.7"&gt;5.33&lt;/a&gt;. Two main things come to mind—the typed exception dispatch, and the &lt;code&gt;finally&lt;/code&gt; blocks. I&amp;rsquo;ve lately been looking at some &lt;code&gt;defer&lt;/code&gt; syntax for a more general-purpose version of &lt;code&gt;finally&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The question of how to handle typed dispatch is a more general one, which needs addressing in a wider language context—perhaps including considerations of signatures, &lt;code&gt;match&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;case&lt;/code&gt; syntax, variable or object slot type assertions, and so on&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="what-s-next-for-you-aside-from-exceptions-in-perl-i-ve-been-reading-about-the-work-you-ve-been-doing-with-curtis-ovid-poe-on-and-your-object-pad-module-would-you-like-to-speak-on-that"&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s next for you aside from exceptions in Perl? I&amp;rsquo;ve been reading about the work you&amp;rsquo;ve been doing with Curtis &amp;ldquo;Ovid&amp;rdquo; Poe on and your Object::Pad module—would you like to speak on that?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, object systems seem to be of interest currently—so part of my thoughts are about &lt;a href="https://github.com/Ovid/Cor/wiki"&gt;Corinna&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Object::Pad"&gt;Object::Pad&lt;/a&gt;. But I&amp;rsquo;m also working on a number of other things. &lt;code&gt;defer&lt;/code&gt; I already mentioned above. Additionally I have some thoughts in the direction of &lt;code&gt;match&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;case&lt;/code&gt;, and a few other bits and pieces. These would mostly be done as CPAN modules at first to experiment with the ideas. I mentioned a lot of them in my recent &lt;a href="https://fosdem.org/2021/schedule/event/perl_in_2025/"&gt;&amp;ldquo;Perl in 2025&amp;rdquo; talk at FOSDEM&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

What does it mean if something was released 2 weeks ago? What if this happened after a 5-year break?</div>

    <title>#505 - Pair programming</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://perlweekly.com/archive/505.html" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Hi,</p>
<p>Pair programming is fun and IMHO extremely efficient. There are plenty of advantages. For example when you are stuck, the other person will likely be able to help you out. You get immediate feedback to your ideas. Doing it live is even more fun. It is almost like doing 'mob programming' or 'ensemble programming' or 'ensemble working' as it is called by various people.</p>
<p>You can watch the recent session Mark Gardner and I had <a href="https://perlmaven.com/course-management-app-in-mojolicious">developing a Mojolicious web application</a>. You can also register for the next session.</p>
<p>Earlier I had two such sessions with Ferenc Erki about <a href="https://code-maven.com/rex">Rex</a> that we will continue.</p>
<p>I'd go even further, if you are interested in having such a session with me, writing some open source code then let me know in a private e-mail.</p>
<p>Enjoy your week!</p></div>

        <![CDATA[<p><i>If you want to challenge yourself on programming, especially on Perl and/or Raku, go to <a href="https://perlweeklychallenge.org/">https://perlweeklychallenge.org</a>, code the latest challenges, submit codes on-time (by GitHub or email).</i></p><p><i>-------------------------------------<br /></i></p><p>My coding momentum is a bit low.</p>

<p>Reflections on the codes I have written:</p>

<p>#095</p>

<p>Task 1: Palindrome Number<br />
TMTOWTDI. On this seemly and actually simple task, I chose to compare the digit one by one.<br />
</p><p>Task 2: Demo Stack<br />
A bit smell of laziness. I did not provide functions when stack is empty and <tt>pop()</tt> or <tt>min()</tt> is called. </p>

<p>#096</p>

<p>Task 1: Reverse Words<br />
A lesson on extra-white space. Oppositely but as lack of caution as a sin, this morning (GMT+8) I found I have forgotten a newline for my code for #105 Task 1.</p>

<p>Task 2: Edit Distance<br />
That was a standard computer science exercise. I was astounded by reading Mr Abigail's blog on the approach on saving memory space.</p>

<p>#097 </p>

<p>Task 1: Caesar Cipher<br />
Trivial.</p>

<p>Task 2: Binary Substrings<br />
Seems to be weird at the first sight, but much simpler after "fourth" thought.<br />
I wish I would have a head for calm analysis when it comes to a more time-limited situation.</p>

<p>#098</p>

<p>Task 1: Read N-characters<br />
Trivial for Perl long-term user, but I had not known <tt>read</tt> before.</p>

<p>Task 2: Search Insert Position<br />
Put a binary search tree as solution. Actually it was modified from some codes for rosalind.info .</p>

<p>#099</p>

<p>Task 1: Pattern Match<br />
KOed by regex.</p>

<p>Task 2: Unique Subsequence<br />
Quite a loaded task for me. idea-&gt;input(letter by letter);</p>

<p>Output: a procedural script.</p>

<p>#100</p><p>
Task 1: Fun Time<br />
When I was in secondary school, one of my class teachers is a strict English teacher. He said we should say "Good noon Mr Chan" if the class begins at 12:00 nn. Yeah, 12:00 nn.</p>

<p>Task 2: Triangle Sum<br />
Ignoring instructions, people took the fastest way: from bottom to top traversal.</p>

<p>I think I am over-unpredictable on how strict I follow the examples or task instructions.</p>

<p>#101<br />
My laziest week recently.  </p>

<p>Task 1: Pack a Spiral<br />
Back to a few years ago, I read a similar task on a competitive programming guide book. At that time I have no clues. A mark of improvement.</p>

<p>Task 2: origin-containing triangle<br />
But still thanks Mr S. Little introduce some basic computer graphics task.</p>

<p>#102</p><p>
Task 1: Rare Numbers<br />
As said, it is faster to generate the numbers, instead of checking the natural numbers one after one... I let go of my previous experience.</p>

<p>Task 2: Hash-counting String<br />
I used recursion for the task. Mr J. Smith's <a href="https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-102/james-smith/perl/ch-2.pl">two elegant lines</a> save the recursion, no wonder he gets the team title of Champion of Feb 2021 soon after he enters the team.</p>

<p>#103</p><p>
Task 1: Chinese Zodiac<br />
Trivial.</p>

<p>Task 2: What’s playing?<br />
I got the "wrong answer" at first. Anyway, I like this task as its nature suggests me getting experience of some of the CPAN modules.</p>

<p>Extra:<br />
Instead of using the <tt>Test::XXXXXX</tt> module, I wrote a short script for test. (Reinventing or whatever, I know there is a book on Perl Testing, I will check it.) This helps me get on the latest #105 -- I undergo time travel again.</p>

<p>Here is my testing script:</p>

<p>One of my neatest things one can learn in calculus class, I would argue, is Newton’s method for computing square roots. One can read more on this elsewhere but this works by using a recurrence relationship, defined using directives, to compute the zero of a function. If the function is <code>x^n - a</code>, the zero we are computing is the nth root of a.</p>
<p>To start the process any <code>x_0</code> may be chosen. Here we pick an integer from 1 to 10 at random.</p>
<p>You can compute this for as many iterations as you’d like, of course, but here even 100 iterations is much more than enough to properly converge.</p>

<h3 id="notes-1">Notes</h3>
<p>My first comment is that I am a terrible singer and have never been able to reliably remember songs with rules like this at all, at any time of my life! Practically speaking that means I may have had to do more research on this part than one might expect. I did find an excellent reference (listed below) which detailed the rules for each case very clearly.</p>
<p>Perhaps the trickiest case in the one in which the name starts with a b, f, or m. For these you need to adjust the one specific <em>rewrite rule</em> which uses that letter. In the example above we see that Mary requires special handling and becomes <em>Fee-fi-mo-ary</em>.</p>
<p>To print the verses out I use a <a href="https://perldoc.perl.org/perlform">Perl Format</a>. Formats are not the most commonly used feature of Perl these days but still have some nice uses such as here where we want to define a simple template for plain text output. Formats can even be used to write to files, but here we just print to the console.</p>
<p>One Format trick which I have not used before is the use of a variable width field. Much of the documentation for Formats has to do with fixed width fields which can be centered, padded left, padded right, involve multiple lines, and so forth. A common case which is not typically well explained is one we need here. Names are of different lengths and may be followed by a comma or an exclamation point. Padding right adds unwanted space before the “,” or “!”. Padding left adds unwanted space before the name. Centering does both! The trick is to use <code>@*</code> for the field specifier in the Format definition. This will allow the value to be substituted in without any padding.</p>

    <title>The Weekly Challenge 103: Astrology and Audio</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://www.rabbitfarm.com/cgi-bin/blosxom/2021/03/14#pwc103" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The examples used here are from the weekly challenge problem statement and demonstrate the working solution.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="part-1"&gt;Part 1&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You are given a year $year. Write a script to determine the Chinese Zodiac for the given year $year.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="solution"&gt;Solution&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="perl"&gt;
use strict;
use warnings;
##
# You are given a year $year.
# Write a script to determine the Chinese Zodiac for the given year $year
##
use constant ELEMENTS =&gt; {1 =&gt; q/Wood/, 2 =&gt; q/Fire/, 3 =&gt; q/Earth/, 4 =&gt; q/Metal/, 0 =&gt; q/Water/};
use constant ANIMALS =&gt;  {1 =&gt; q/Rat/, 2 =&gt; q/Ox/, 3 =&gt; q/Tiger/, 4 =&gt; q/Rabbit/, 5 =&gt; q/Dragon/, 6 =&gt; q/Snake/, 7 =&gt; q/Horse/, 8 =&gt; q/Goat/, 9 =&gt; q/Monkey/, 10 =&gt; q/Rooster/, 11 =&gt; q/Dog/, 0 =&gt; q/Pig/}; 

sub chinese_zodiac{
    my($year) = @_;
    return ELEMENTS-&gt;{$year % 5} . " " . ANIMALS-&gt;{($year + 9) % 12};    
} 

MAIN:{
    my($YEAR);
    $YEAR = 2017;
    print chinese_zodiac($YEAR) . "\n";
    $YEAR = 1938;
    print chinese_zodiac($YEAR) . "\n";
}  
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3 id="sample-run"&gt;Sample Run&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="shell"&gt;
$ perl perl/ch-1.pl
Fire Rooster
Earth Tiger
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3 id="notes"&gt;Notes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I first saw the problem statement for this part of the challenge I took a look at the cited Wikipedia article, but it just seemed like a real slog of a read. So I decided to just work backwards from the examples given! Pretty much this seems to boil down to a straightforward modular arithmetic problem. The values are all known and so I hard code then with &lt;code&gt;use constant&lt;/code&gt; and then use them directly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="part-2"&gt;Part 2&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Write a program to output which file is currently playing.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="solution-1"&gt;Solution&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="perl"&gt;
use strict;
use warnings;

sub song_times{
    my($file_name) = @_; 
    my %song_times;
    my @song_order;
    my $length = 0; 
    my $index = 0;  
    if(!$file_name){

&lt;p&gt;In the spirit of good sportsmanship wrote the code to fit the specification given, but then allow for defaults, such as reading from &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;DATA&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; and using the value of &lt;code&gt;time()&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The way this works here is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The file list is read in and the times of the songs and the total length of the whole playlist is saved.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We find out where in the playlist “cycle” we are.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Given the time of the cycle we “seek” to the position of the current song.&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>Why I wrote Net::Google::CivicInformation</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://perl.com/article/why-i-wrote-net-google-civicinformation/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">

&lt;p&gt;Before I became a computer programmer, I tried my hand at being a human programmer, in the form of a wordsmith, as I called myself then. I had various jobs as a writer, editor, translator and journalist, but I met with little success, for two main reasons. In those days you needed a publisher to find your work interesting enough to publish before anyone could read it, and that was a pretty high bar. And in the second place, it was difficult to get the humans to react to the content I wrote (I&amp;rsquo;m still exercised that the movie reviewer would get more letters to the editor than I did after a political exposé that took a month to produce).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I still remember the moment of awe and inspiration in early 1994 or so, when after acquiring a sparkly new i286 PC at Circuit City, I discovered the World Wide Web and its promise of a world free of publishers and constraining editors. I jumped right in and became one of the first &amp;ldquo;webmasters,&amp;rdquo; which led to a job where I needed to learn Perl. Over a short time I began to thrill more at the construction of the engine to publish the content than at the creating of it. I still had the barrier-free entry point, and as to my second gripe &amp;hellip; well, I found that computers respond much more predictably to my writing than humans ever did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fast forward almost 25 years and lots of things have changed, but I still get an itch scratched by building &amp;ldquo;websites.&amp;rdquo; Of course now they are called REST APIs or webapps or microservices or whatever the newest term is, and I deliver mostly JSON data packets to other computers inside big organizations—it&amp;rsquo;s been 20 years since I used CGI.pm—but I&amp;rsquo;m very blessed to have had a long career in the same field with fast-evolving technologies, supported throughout by Perl and its amazing community of contributors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You&amp;rsquo;d think maybe that after spending all week building APIs at work I&amp;rsquo;d be sated, but last weekend found me hankering for a new project, something outside work, but using my expertise, and something that could have real value for other people. I also specifically wanted to see if I could provide for the CPAN a library to interface to a useful public API. I&amp;rsquo;ve contributed a handful of insignificant distributions over the years, and found it to be very satisfying and also that it forces me to up my game as far as quality control and attention to detail. Yet I&amp;rsquo;d never found an opportunity to contribute a module in the area I know best.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Usually all the best ideas are taken, of course, especially when it comes to the CPAN. It seemed there was a client for every API you could think of, but eventually I stumbled upon one that I found to be super-cool, and unsupported in Perl! The &lt;a href="https://developers.google.com/civic-information"&gt;Google Civic Information API&lt;/a&gt; provides extensive contact information for all elected officials from head of state down to county tax collector for any US address.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="silence-betokens-consent"&gt;Silence betokens consent&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like many of you, I suppose, I am still somewhat shell-shocked at the sustained assault on democracy and democratic participation that has been going on lately, not to mention that so many elected &amp;ldquo;leaders&amp;rdquo; seem to be insulated from the people. I also considered the COVID pandemic—not just its awful toll and the crass incompetence of the government response, but also how it has made us all much more isolated from each other, and how technologies that bring people together are even more important now that, for example, you can&amp;rsquo;t readily show up with a neighborhood community group to a crowded county board meeting to make your views heard. But silence betokens consent, and if our elected officials don&amp;rsquo;t hear from us they will just continue to do what they do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With all that in mind I set to creating a Perl client for the API. The first step was to obtain an auth token, which Google provides to developers for free (with a limit on daily queries). Authentication is extremely simple, so using &lt;a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/HTTP::Tiny"&gt;HTTP::Tiny&lt;/a&gt; I quickly had a client in my module that could connect to the API and make queries. Because elected officials&amp;rsquo; contact information is only one thing the API provides, I made a parent class &lt;a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Net::Google::CivicInformation"&gt;Net::Google::CivicInformation&lt;/a&gt; and subclass &lt;a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Net::Google::CivicInformation::Representatives"&gt;Net::Google::CivicInformation::Representatives&lt;/a&gt; handling the representatives-related code. This will allow me or other authors to write sibling subclasses for other endpoints in future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s a portion of the subclass for fetching Representatives data:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"&gt;&lt;code class="language-perl" data-lang="perl"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef"&gt;package&lt;/span&gt; Net::Google::CivicInformation::Representatives;

&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef"&gt;our&lt;/span&gt; $VERSION &lt;span style="color:#f92672"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color:#e6db74"&gt;&amp;#39;1.02&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;;

&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef"&gt;use&lt;/span&gt; strict;
&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef"&gt;use&lt;/span&gt; warnings;
&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef"&gt;use&lt;/span&gt; v5&lt;span style="color:#ae81ff"&gt;.10&lt;/span&gt;;

&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef"&gt;use&lt;/span&gt; Carp &lt;span style="color:#e6db74"&gt;&amp;#39;croak&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;;
&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef"&gt;use&lt;/span&gt; Function::Parameters;
&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef"&gt;use&lt;/span&gt; JSON::MaybeXS;
&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef"&gt;use&lt;/span&gt; Try::Tiny;
&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef"&gt;use&lt;/span&gt; Types::Common::String &lt;span style="color:#e6db74"&gt;&amp;#39;NonEmptyStr&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;;
&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef"&gt;use&lt;/span&gt; URI;
&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef"&gt;use&lt;/span&gt; Moo;
&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef"&gt;use&lt;/span&gt; namespace::clean;

extends &lt;span style="color:#e6db74"&gt;&amp;#39;Net::Google::CivicInformation&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;;

&lt;span style="color:#75715e"&gt;##&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef"&gt;sub&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color:#a6e22e"&gt;_build__api_url&lt;/span&gt; {&lt;span style="color:#e6db74"&gt;&amp;#39;representatives&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;}

&lt;span style="color:#75715e"&gt;##&lt;/span&gt;
method representatives_for_address (NonEmptyStr $address) {
    &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef"&gt;my&lt;/span&gt; $uri &lt;span style="color:#f92672"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; URI&lt;span style="color:#f92672"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt;( $self&lt;span style="color:#f92672"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;_api_url );
    $uri&lt;span style="color:#f92672"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;query_form( address &lt;span style="color:#f92672"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; $address, key &lt;span style="color:#f92672"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; $self&lt;span style="color:#f92672"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;api_key );

    &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef"&gt;my&lt;/span&gt; $call &lt;span style="color:#f92672"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; $self&lt;span style="color:#f92672"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;_client&lt;span style="color:#f92672"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;get( $uri );
    &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef"&gt;my&lt;/span&gt; $response;

    &lt;span style="color:#f92672"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The parent class has the &lt;code&gt;api_url&lt;/code&gt; attribute whose coercion prepends the root URL to the value returned by the subclasses&amp;rsquo; builder override. Note the use of &lt;a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Function::Parameters"&gt;Function::Parameters&lt;/a&gt; for signatures and &lt;a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Type::Tiny"&gt;Type::Tiny&lt;/a&gt; for type validation, which reduce the subroutine boilerplate nicely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the work in creating the client distribution was in deciding how to marshal and reformat the extensive JSON data structure returned by Google. The results are organized into &lt;a href="http://docs.opencivicdata.org/en/latest/proposals/0002.html"&gt;Open Civic Data Divisions&lt;/a&gt;, an international standard adopted by Google for its service. An OCD Division ID can be as generic as &lt;code&gt;ocd-division/country:us&lt;/code&gt; or as specific as &lt;code&gt;ocd-division/country:us/state:ny/place:new_york/council_district:36&lt;/code&gt;. Google provides filtering on the data sets but I chose to use a high-level endpoint that returns all levels of officials for a single specific address (although a zip code alone works most of the time as well).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a few attempts I had it working in a simple way that was pleasing to me as a consumer of the module, and I documented the arrayref of hashrefs it would return representing the, um, representatives. I wrote some tests and bundled up the distribution and uploaded it to PAUSE.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="setting-up-the-webservice"&gt;Setting up the webservice&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next step was to put the new client to use, and a public-facing web app seemed the obvious choice. I&amp;rsquo;ve learned over the years that the majority of people still think of a .com domain as most inviting, and that a readable name is key. I settled on &lt;strong&gt;ContactMyReps&lt;/strong&gt; for the name, registered the &lt;a href="https://contactmyreps.com"&gt;contactmyreps.com&lt;/a&gt; domain, and pointed it at my server. At work I use &lt;a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Mojolicious"&gt;Mojolicious&lt;/a&gt; but I far prefer &lt;a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Dancer2"&gt;Dancer2&lt;/a&gt;—it feels much more light weight and flexible and Perlish to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The POST route handler for the lookup query:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"&gt;&lt;code class="language-perl" data-lang="perl"&gt;post &lt;span style="color:#e6db74"&gt;&amp;#39;/find-by-address&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color:#f92672"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef"&gt;sub&lt;/span&gt; {
    &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef"&gt;my&lt;/span&gt; $params &lt;span style="color:#f92672"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; params;

    &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; ( &lt;span style="color:#f92672"&gt;not&lt;/span&gt; $params&lt;span style="color:#f92672"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;{address} ) {
        send_error(&lt;span style="color:#e6db74"&gt;&amp;#39;Error: address is required.&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style="color:#ae81ff"&gt;400&lt;/span&gt; );
    }

    &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef"&gt;my&lt;/span&gt; $client &lt;span style="color:#f92672"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; Net::Google::CivicInformation::Representatives&lt;span style="color:#f92672"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt;;

    &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef"&gt;my&lt;/span&gt; %result &lt;span style="color:#f92672"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; ( address &lt;span style="color:#f92672"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; $params&lt;span style="color:#f92672"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;{address} );

    &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef"&gt;my&lt;/span&gt; $response &lt;span style="color:#f92672"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; $client&lt;span style="color:#f92672"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;representatives_for_address($params&lt;span style="color:#f92672"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;{address});

    &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; ( $response&lt;span style="color:#f92672"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;{error} ) {
        $result{error} &lt;span style="color:#f92672"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; $response&lt;span style="color:#f92672"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;{error};
    }
    &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef"&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; {
        $result{officials} &lt;span style="color:#f92672"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; decode_utf8(encode_json($response&lt;span style="color:#f92672"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;{officials}));
    }

    &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; template &lt;span style="color:#e6db74"&gt;&amp;#39;find-by-address&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style="color:#f92672"&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;%result;
};&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The backend side of the webapp was done in an hour, and then I set to the presentation. It took a while but I came up with a design that seemed functional and aesthetically acceptable. After testing locally I was ready to deploy, and after creating a new TLS cert and updating the &lt;code&gt;Apache&lt;/code&gt; config, the site was up and running. (The source code is available &lt;a href="https://github.com/1nickt/ContactMyReps"&gt;on Github&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://perl.com/images/why_i_wrote_net_google_civicinformation/expanded.png" alt="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I sent the link to the to a couple of friends to see what they thought, and posted to &lt;a href="http://blogs.perl.org/users/1nickt/2021/02/who-you-gonna-call-perl-client-and-website-for-google-civic-information-api.html"&gt;blogs.perl.org&lt;/a&gt; to get some live testing, and was pleased when other people started using the site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="wrapping-up"&gt;Wrapping up&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having conceived of and implemented the idea in less than 24 hours, I was pretty exhilarated and on a roll. I decided that if a thing was worth doing, it was worth doing well, so I signed up for a few hundred dollars in Google advertising to promote the site next to relevant search results. I also set up a Buy Me a Coffee account and placed a button on the search results display. It costs about $1.20 to buy a click to the site, so I figure if 10% of the visitors contribute something, they&amp;rsquo;ll pay for the advertising to reach new audiences and the thing will be self-sustaining.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in all it was a fun way to spend a winter weekend. The service is online at &lt;a href="https://contactmyreps.com"&gt;https://contactmyreps.com&lt;/a&gt; if you&amp;rsquo;d like to check it out!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My approach here is &lt;em&gt;brute force&lt;/em&gt;, but with a slight twist. I parallelize the computations by using &lt;a href="https://perldoc.perl.org/threads"&gt;Threads&lt;/a&gt;. I’ve used Threads in the past, for example in &lt;a href="http://www.rabbitfarm.com/cgi-bin/blosxom/perl/2019/05/18"&gt;Challenge 008&lt;/a&gt; Threads were used to compute Perfect Numbers. The search for Perfect Numbers bears enough similarity to the current problem with Rare Numbers that the code from Challenge 008 will also be similar to this week’s code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are four CPU cores on the system I am running this code on. We can create any number of Threads that we need, of course, but Perl Threads are a special sort of “thread” in that they create new copies of the running interpreter and so consume a bit more memory than the sort of light weight threads you may learn about in C or Java. In the interest of conserving memory, and to avoid having multiple &lt;em&gt;interpreter threads&lt;/em&gt; running on the same core we’ll just create no more than four Threads at a time. &lt;em&gt;Note: Ultimately it is the OS which schedules where things run but, generally speaking, four threads on a four core system will each run on individual cores.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can demonstrate this to ourselves by increasing the number of threads beyond the number of cores and not seeing an improvement in execution time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each Thread will get a slice of the search space. Each slice is of size &lt;code&gt;10 ** ($N - 1)&lt;/code&gt;. Threads run &lt;code&gt;sub rare_number_check&lt;/code&gt; which implements the definition of a Rare Number.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I chose to use a bare block with &lt;a href="https://perldoc.perl.org/functions/redo"&gt;redo&lt;/a&gt;. This is purely a matter of style and aesthetics. I’d argue that in this case it is more readable than the equivalent &lt;code&gt;for&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;while&lt;/code&gt; loops would be.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;sub rare_number&lt;/code&gt; which generates and co-ordinates the Threads also uses redo for similar reasons.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Interestingly Perl is clever enough to return a integer with no decimal part in the case of a perfect square! Checking to see if we have a perfect square then becomes a matter of checking to see if the value returned by &lt;a href="https://perldoc.perl.org/functions/sqrt"&gt;sqrt&lt;/a&gt; contains a decimal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="part-2"&gt;Part 2&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You are given a positive integer &lt;code&gt;$N&lt;/code&gt;. Write a script to produce hash counting string of that length.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="solution-1"&gt;Solution&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="perl"&gt;
use strict;
use warnings;

sub hash_counting_string{
    my($n) = @_;
    return "" if $n == 0; 
    return "#" if $n == 1; 
    my $h = "$n#";  
    return hash_counting_string($n - length($h)) . $h;  
}

MAIN:{
    print hash_counting_string(1). "\n";
    print hash_counting_string(2). "\n";
    print hash_counting_string(3). "\n";
    print hash_counting_string(10). "\n";
    print hash_counting_string(14). "\n";
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3 id="sample-run-1"&gt;Sample Run&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="shell"&gt;
$ perl perl/ch-2.pl 
#
2#
#3#
#3#5#7#10#
2#4#6#8#11#14#
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3 id="notes-1"&gt;Notes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is what I consider to be a nice clean recursive implementation. When I first saw Part 2 it seemed a bit more complicated than it would later prove to be. My thought process was along the lines of “I am not sure how I would do this in Perl, and I have no idea of how this would go in Prolog either!” Often times I will rely on the insights gained by doing it in one to aid the implementation of the other. In times like this, with no immediately clear solution, I prefer to start off in Perl, and write it in a way which would allow for reproduction in Prolog. Then, as necessary, remove any vestiges of the solution’s origins by conforming to idiomatic Prolog by ensuring things are done declaratively, logically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is actually a long acknowledged use of Perl: &lt;em&gt;algorithm development.&lt;/em&gt; If you see the &lt;a href="http://www.rabbitfarm.com/cgi-bin/blosxom/prolog/2021/03/07"&gt;Prolog solution for Part 2&lt;/a&gt; you can detect the obvious origins!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As far as this solution in Perl, perhaps the main “trick” is that we must account for the length of the numeral. So, for example, “14#” consumes three characters and so the next time through we need to generate the hash count for 11 = 14 - 3.&lt;/p&gt;
