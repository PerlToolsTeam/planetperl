<h4>Bye, 2020</h4>

<p>There are 28 entries on this blog in the Year 2020.</p>

<p>In February, I started to join "<a href="perlweeklychallenge.org/">The Weekly Challenge</a>"(PWC in short, as initially it was called "Perl Weekly Challenge" while the name "Perl6" hadn't been replaced by Raku). Then I slowly involved in the Perl community as a beginner. </p>

<p>At first, my codes were messy! I have forgotten from where I heard of <i>Perl Best Practices</i>(by Damian Conway; btw, I have to revisit it again), but have been trying to adopt some of its pieces of advice as many as possible. And then I read more codes and decided to maintain my code more modularized and structured; in addition, I have learnt to use the unit testing package in Perl (thanks to <a href="https://www.perlmonks.com/?node=Tutorials">Perl Monks</a>).</p>

<p>At a very early time, I just wanted to use programming for my amateur mathematician dream. My codes are encouraged by the code reviewer Ryan Thompson as "analytic". The second week I joined PWC, I hit on my favorite stuff ‒ number theory in math. I provided a different but optimized solution. [1] It started a series of email conversations between Ryan and me. Besides "hard knowledge" of Perl I learnt from the discussion, I started blogging here with his encouragement.</p>

<p>One of my foremost posts, on my initial plan, is <a href="http://blogs.perl.org/users/c_y_fung/2020/03/to-study-plan-a-beginning-to-oo-or-packages-in-perl.html">to learn the object-oriented side of Perl</a>, hasn't been really started. In November, I started to learning Java seriously; see if an "OOP-oriented" language can help me to achieve my plan on OO Perl. In addition or in a more practical concern, learning Java is to achieve my aimed career field. (I don't want to work in Food and Beverage in Hong Kong anymore... Sorry for having to keep the story private.) (By the way, for some schema or applications, Perl cannot be a good choice for novices. I found some Perl books often assume readers having knowledge of C or Linux. Anyway I have switched to Linux in the middle of 2020. :P )</p>

<p>Happily, I got the PWC monthly champion title with an Amazon book coupon (sponsored by <a href="https://perl.careers/">Perl Careers</a>) in August.</p>

<p>One of the books I bought by the coupon is <i>Mastering Algorithms with Perl</i> (by John MacDonald)(an eye-opener!).</p>

<p>In December, I joined the famous coding yearly event "<a href="adventofcode.com/">Advent Of Code</a>". 22 "golden stars" are got (the full score is 48 golden stars); mostly through Java, one or two through a combination of Java and Perl; and, <a href="https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/18">a day</a> I completed it with Perl.</p>

<p>Those two tasks are clothed with basic arithmetic and I found how convenient to deal them with Perl. Actually I was slacking as I have observed the maximum number of layers of brackets of the raw data is two, so a subroutine <tt>killparentheses</tt> were used twice. <a href="https://github.com/E7-87-83/AdventOfCode2020/blob/main/advent18.pl">My script</a> is unable to be solved for general cases effectively.</p>

<h4>The Weekly Challenge #089 ~ #093</h4>

<p>Now, it is time to pay some debt ‒ a part of the debt is skipping blogging for PWC four weeks, the other part is completing more details on my previously submitted codes.</p>

<p><u>#089</u></p>

<p><u>+ Task 2 Magic Sum</u></p>

<p>After coding and submission, I suddenly worried that the unchecked equations. Luckily "the sum of a face minus the sums of two segments" is the sum of a segment.</p>

<p>Seems it is just my luck. (<a href="<br />

<p><u>#090</u></p>

<p><u>+ Task 1 DNA sequence</u></p>

<p>My solution is not optimal as it visited the sequence four times. Well, poor concern.</p>

<p>By the way, I came across a good website, <a href="http://rosalind.info">http://rosalind.info</a> . </p>

<p>The application of Perl on bioinformatics is rather famous(e.g. BioPerl). One can practise coding (esp data structures and algorithms), and learn basic bioinformatics at the same time on the site! Biology is one of my favorite subjects in high school, hope that I can grasp some time for that website.</p>

<p><u>+ Task 2 Insert Interval</u></p>

<p><u>+ Task 2 Sum Path</u></p>

<p>A revisit to binary tree. I still use the array representation of a binary tree with two subroutines <tt>jumptoLc</tt> and <tt>jumptoRc</tt> (short for "jump to Left/Right child").</p>

    <title>Archiving CPAN logs in GitHub Actions</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://dev.to/davorg/archiving-cpan-logs-in-github-actions-2hfd" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;As more and more people have started to use &lt;a href="https://github.com/actions"&gt;GitHub Actions&lt;/a&gt; to test their CPAN modules, a pretty standard version of a basic configuration file has emerged. It looks something like this:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;name: CI

on:
  push:
    branches: [ master ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ master ]
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }}
    strategy:
      matrix:
        os: ['ubuntu-latest', 'macos-latest', 'windows-
latest']
        perl: [ 'latest' ]
    name: Perl ${{ matrix.perl }} on ${{ matrix.os }}
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Set up perl
        uses: shogo82148/actions-setup-perl@v1
        with:
          perl-version: ${{ matrix.perl }}
      - name: Perl version
        run: perl -V
      - name: Install modules
        run: cpanm --installdeps .
      - name: Run tests
        run: prove -lv t
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel"&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action"&gt;
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I've been slowly adding something similar to this to all of the GitHub repos that contain my CPAN modules. And it mostly works pretty well. There are just a few problems that I'm ironing out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of them is a problem where some of the required CPAN modules don't install cleanly, so the run is aborted. But I think I've found a tool that is going to help me fix this problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You'll see that I use &lt;code&gt;cpanm&lt;/code&gt; to install the modules that are required to run the tests. And &lt;code&gt;cpanm&lt;/code&gt; writes a detailed log of what it is doing which is invaluable when something goes wrong - as you can get the error messages from the log file. Unfortunately, this doesn't work well in a CI environment like GitHub Actions. All I see in the log of the run is something like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;Building and testing Inline-C-0.81 ... FAIL
! Installing Inline::C failed. See /home/runner/.cpanm/work/1609767557.4781/build.log for details. 
Retry with --force to force install it.
! Installing the dependencies failed: Module 'Inline::C' is not installed
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel"&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action"&gt;
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That &lt;code&gt;build.log&lt;/code&gt; file is the one we need to see. But it's on the container that has been used to run your tests, and by the time you're looking at that error, the container has vanished into the ether taking your build log with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But we can stop it being removed. GitHub Actions has a feature called "artifacts" where you can store items that are created in a job run so that you can examine them in more detail later on. We can use that to archive our build logs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've started adding this step to my GitHub Action config files:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;- name: Archive CPAN logs
  if: ${{ failure() }}
  uses: actions/upload-artifact@v2
  with:
    name: cpan_log
    path: .cpanm/work/*/build.log
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel"&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action"&gt;
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This adds another step into my process. It only runs if another step fails in some way. It uses the standard action &lt;code&gt;actions/upload-artifact@v2&lt;/code&gt; to archive my build logs. Now, when something goes wrong in my tests the job page will have a link labelled "cpan_log" which I can click on to download a copy of the &lt;code&gt;cpanm&lt;/code&gt; build log which I can then examine at my leisure to work out what the problem is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I just need to add this to all of my existing CI workflows so that I can start to fix some of the issues I can see on my &lt;a href="https://cpandashboard.com/DAVECROSS/"&gt;CPAN Dashboard&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

<p>Last January <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/perl/comments/ah29uh/updated_json_parsers_test_suite/">there was a post on reddit</a> which claimed that my module <a href="https://metacpan.org/release/JSON-Parse">JSON::Parse</a> was not only failing some of the JSON Test Suite tests, but also crashing on one of them. Anyway I should have got around to doing something about it sooner, but here are my conclusions.</p>

<p>First of all there was <a href="http://matrix.cpantesters.org/?dist=JSON-Parse%200.55_02">a crash on one of the files</a>, which went something like this: <code>[{"":[{"":[{""</code>, repeated about 100,000 times. (The actual file is <a href="https://metacpan.org/source/BKB/JSON-Parse-0.55_02/t%2Fn_structure_open_array_object.json">here</a> if you really want to see it.) Investigating it using a LInode, I found that after 80,000 open brackets the stack was overflowing, causing the crash to occur. If I added a printf in the midst of my code the printf would cause the stack overflow, so it wasn't actually due to my code but just because the stack size seems to be quite small on Linux.</p>

<p>There are various things one could do to tackle this, but it does seem a bit unlikely that anyone would want to have that many open brackets, so what I did as a strategy was to add a "max_depth" of parsing after which it would stop. I thought 10,000 open { and [ would be enough for anyone, and it would satisfy the people who want to run the JSON Test Suite tests, but I also added <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/release/BKB/JSON-Parse-0.57_01/lib/JSON/Parse.pm#set_max_depth">an option for the user to alter the max depth</a> and <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/release/BKB/JSON-Parse-0.57_01/lib/JSON/Parse.pm#get_max_depth">get the max depth</a> as well.</p>

<p>After finishing that I started to wonder what other modules were doing that they had passed this test. A quick glance at the Cpanel::JSON::XS documentation and it seems that those people had the same idea, but their maximum depth is a measly 512 as opposed to my whopping 10,000. I'm not sure which is better or worse. 😕</p>

<p>There were a couple of other tests in the JSON Test Suite which I failed, which were tests about Unicode; the JSON Test Suite thinks that it is compulsory for JSON parsers to pass through Unicode non-characters, UTF-8 representing surrogate pairs, and so on. I'm not really sure why they think so, <a href="https://github.com/nst/JSONTestSuite/issues/52">there is a bit of a discussion on the github</a> but that doesn't strike me as being very convincing. Frankly I think JSON::Parse is much more useful tool for users if it rejects the non-characters and other crap, 💩 so I would need to see much stronger justification than I have done to alter it in the way that JSON Test Suite suggests.
<a href="https://xkcd.com/380/">
<img alt="emoticon.png" src="http://blogs.perl.org/users/ben_bullock/emoticon.png" width="740" height="191" class="mt-image-none" style="" /></a></p>

<p>In other news, I've also made it possible for the module to be installed from github, so it should now be possible to start using continuous integration. I've already got Travis working, and I hope to add some more useful things soon.</p>

He gives the Perl community enormous value via his &lt;a href="https://perlweeklychallenge.org/"&gt;Perl Weekly Challenge&lt;/a&gt; and by being the co-editor of the Perl Weekly&lt;/a&gt;. Even if the connection is indirect, the time and energy he spends on Perl helps us stay employable with Perl. It would be really nice if you, who enjoy the fruits of his work, showed your gratitude via &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/manwar/"&gt;his Patreon account&lt;/a&gt;.  It can be as low as $1/month or you can beat the average which is slightly above $6/month.</content>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Hi and welcome to 2021!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just got the first shot of the COVID-19 vaccine this morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My New Year's request is to &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/manwar/"&gt;support the work of Manwar&lt;/a&gt;. You know him. He gives the Perl community enormous value via his &lt;a href="https://perlweeklychallenge.org/"&gt;Perl Weekly Challenge&lt;/a&gt; and by being the co-editor of the Perl Weekly&lt;/a&gt;. He is now at $105 from 16 people. Let's double both numbers!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am running a poll: &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6751738129025134592/"&gt;In which subject in Perl do you feel you'd need better knowledge?&lt;/a&gt; and The Perl Foundations is running a survey: &lt;a href="https://news.perlfoundation.org/post/newperluserssurvey"&gt;Coding in Perl? What support do you need?&lt;/a&gt;. They will take less than five minutes of your time. Please fill them both in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enjoy the next year!&lt;/p&gt;</content>

&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind that any two points determine a line. Therefore to consider all possible non-trivial lines we need to review all triples of points. This method will work in the most general case when the starting data may contain multiple lines with a larger number of points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In determining collinearity I calculate the area of a triangle using the triple of points. If the area is zero we know that all the points lay on the same line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is straightforward enough, at a high level anyway: (1) Get all paths and then (2) sum all the nodes on the paths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I am always happy to have a chance to use the &lt;a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/distribution/Graph/lib/Graph.pod"&gt;Graph module&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Graph module has a bunch of nice algorithms implemented but what we want here is not a &lt;em&gt;shortest path&lt;/em&gt; but &lt;em&gt;all paths&lt;/em&gt;. The Graph module doesn’t have anything for us to use for that. Implementing a recursive &lt;em&gt;Depth First Search&lt;/em&gt; and collecting all the paths is not such a hard thing to do, but in the &lt;strong&gt;Holiday Spirit&lt;/strong&gt; (i.e. laziness) I just re-used &lt;a href="https://www.perlmonks.org/?node_id=381608"&gt;Ikegami&lt;/a&gt;’s code. See the References section.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I first used the pack/unpack trick for summing array back in &lt;a href="http://www.rabbitfarm.com/cgi-bin/blosxom/perl/2019/05/09"&gt;Challenge 007&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In some regards, I'm a very old school person. For example I do not like the concept of streaming audio (via Spotify et.al.). I want &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MP3&lt;/span&gt;s on my hard disk (and/or vinyl on my record player). I want access to my music when I'm offline (and I'm offline a lot) and without using a so-called smart phone (I prefer vintage &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USB&lt;/span&gt;-stick &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MP3 &lt;/span&gt;players). My partner thinks the same (I guess 25+ years of my propaganda had some influence..).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But "modern" sites make it rather hard to actually download content (even if it's free). They offer links to a myriad of apps, but often no download button. At least a lot of podcasts still provide an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RSS &lt;/span&gt;feed. So when my partner cannot download a newly discovered podcast, she asked me if I can do it for her. Which I'm of course happy to do, and which is often done with a few lines of code:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;#!/usr/bin/env perl

use strict;
use warnings;
use 5.030;

use XML::Feed;
use URI;
use String::Ident;

my $feed = XML::Feed-&amp;gt;parse( URI-&amp;gt;new( $ARGV[0] ) );

for my $entry ( $feed-&amp;gt;entries ) {
    my $date = $entry-&amp;gt;issued;
    $date =~ s/T.*$//;
    my $filename = join( '-', $date, String::Ident-&amp;gt;cleanup( $entry-&amp;gt;title ) ) . '.mp3';
    next if -f $filename;
    say &amp;quot;wget -O $filename &amp;quot; . $entry-&amp;gt;enclosure-&amp;gt;url;
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here I use &lt;a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/XML::Feed"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;XML&lt;/span&gt;::Feed&lt;/a&gt; to fetch and parse the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RSS &lt;/span&gt;feed, passing in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;URL &lt;/span&gt;as the first command line argument. I create a nice filename based on the date the podcast was &lt;code&gt;issued&lt;/code&gt; (removing the time-part) and a &lt;code&gt;cleanup()ed&lt;/code&gt; version of the title. (&lt;a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/String::Ident"&gt;String::Ident&lt;/a&gt; is a nice little helper module Jozef created for a project we were working on some time ago).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the filename already exists in the current directory, we skip, because we don't need to download it again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I output a &lt;a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/wget/"&gt;wget&lt;/a&gt; command to download the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;URL &lt;/span&gt;(provided by &lt;code&gt;$entry-&amp;gt;enclosure-&amp;gt;url&lt;/code&gt;) and save it under the nice filename.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why do I not download the file directly in the script?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just find it easier to use an external tool, especially as I like to pipe the output of this script into a file, so I can munge the file a bit. Eg, for this podcast, I did not download all 131 episodes, but only the 5 oldest and the 5 newest:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~/media/podcasts$ fetch_podcast.pl https://example.com/podcast.rss &amp;gt; all
~/media/podcasts$ head -n 5 all &amp;gt; test_it
~/media/podcasts$ tail -n 5 all &amp;gt;&amp;gt; test_it
~/media/podcasts$ bash test_it
...&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nice and easy!&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>CPAN vs Hackage releases, Part 1</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://perlancar.wordpress.com/2021/01/03/cpan-vs-hackage-releases-part-1/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Back in mid-November 2020, I noticed that &lt;a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/"&gt;Hackage&lt;/a&gt; (the Haskell package repository) probably has roughly the same daily upload rate as CPAN, or even higher. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the &lt;a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/api"&gt;Hackage API&lt;/a&gt; does not provide a way to list releases (uploads), I had to &lt;a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/http-tiny-plugin-every"&gt;download&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/packages/recent"&gt;recent additions&lt;/a&gt; page periodically, &lt;a href="https://github.com/sharyanto/scripts/blob/master/parse-hackage-page"&gt;parse&lt;/a&gt; each page, and &lt;a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/combine-overlap"&gt;merge&lt;/a&gt; the results into a single large list. Because I have just collected the recent additions page since mid-November, I&amp;#039;m looking at December 2020 period. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;pre class="fixed_width_section"&gt;% http-tiny-plugin-every --every 3h http://hackage.haskell.org/packages/recent --dir . --trace
% for f in 2*.log; do parse-hackage-page &amp;quot;$f&amp;quot; --format ltsv &amp;gt; &amp;quot;$$.ltsv&amp;quot;; done
% combine-overlap 2*.ltsv &amp;gt; hackage_release_202012.ltsv
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt; For CPAN, the MetaCPAN API lets us query various things in many ways so the simple task of listing recent releases is not a problem at all. I&amp;#039;m using a &lt;a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/list-metacpan-releases"&gt;CLI&lt;/a&gt; to do this: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;pre class="fixed_width_section"&gt;% list-metacpan-releases --from-date 2020-12-01 --to-date 2020-12-31 --json &amp;gt; cpan_release_202012.json
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt; With this two pieces of data, I just need to perform some SQL (again, using &lt;a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/fsql"&gt;CLI&lt;/a&gt; for this) to get what I want. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So for December 2020, there are 957 releases: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;pre class="fixed_width_section"&gt;% fsql -a cpan_release_202012.json:t &amp;#039;SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t&amp;#039; -f tsv
COUNT
957
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt; while for Hackage there are 629: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;pre class="fixed_width_section"&gt;% fsql -a hackage_release_202012.ltsv:t &amp;#039;SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t&amp;#039; -f tsv
COUNT
629
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt; As for number of authors who did releases in this period, the two are more similar: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;pre class="fixed_width_section"&gt;% fsql -a cpan_release_202012.json:t &amp;#039;SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT author) FROM t&amp;#039; -f tsv
COUNT
207
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt; while for Hackage there are 191: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;pre class="fixed_width_section"&gt;% fsql -a hackage_release_202012.ltsv:t &amp;#039;SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT author) FROM t&amp;#039; -f tsv
COUNT
191
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt; So this does confirm my guess that the upload activity for both repositories are currently in the same order of magnitude, but does not confirm the suspicion that Hackage is more active than CPAN, at least in December 2020. I plan to do a follow up next year in January after I collected all 2021 data.&lt;/p&gt;

        <![CDATA[<p>These are some answers to the Week 93 of the <a href="https://perlweeklychallenge.org/blog/perl-weekly-challenge-093/">Perl Weekly Challenge</a> organized by <a href="http://blogs.perl.org/users/mohammad_s_anwar/">Mohammad S. Anwar</a>.</p>

<p><em>Spoiler Alert:</em> This weekly challenge deadline is due in a day or so. This blog post offers some solutions to this challenge, please don’t read on if you intend to complete the challenge on your own.</p>

<h2>Task 1: Max Points</h2>

<p><em>You are given set of co-ordinates <code>@N</code>.</em></p>

<p><em>Write a script to count maximum points on a straight line when given co-ordinates plotted on 2-d plane.</em></p>

<p><em>Example 1:</em></p>

<pre><code>|
|     x
|   x
| x
+ _ _ _ _

Input: (1,1), (2,2), (3,3)
Output: 3
</code></pre>

<p><em>Example 2:</em></p>

<pre><code>|
|
| x       x
|   x
| x   x
+ _ _ _ _ _

Input: (1,1), (2,2), (3,1), (1,3), (5,3)
Output: 3
</code></pre>

<p>From the examples provided, it appears that the given co-ordinates will be integers, that the points of a straight line have to be immediate neighbors and that the lines can only be horizontal, vertical or diagonal. Because of that, I will not try to solve the task with math formulas, as it is somewhat impractical to deal with integers in geometric equations. Also, representing a vertical line with a math equation is a mess.</p>

<h3>Max Points in Raku</h3>

<p>With such a type of problem, the first thing I usually want to do is to make a graphical representation of the point cloud, so that I can visually verify the test results. This is done in the following <code>display-points</code> subroutine:</p>

<pre><code>sub display-points (@points) {
    my @sorted = reverse sort 
        { $^a[0] &lt;=&gt; $^b[0] || $^b[1] &lt;=&gt; $^a[1] }, 
        map { $_.reverse }, @points;
    my $current = (@sorted.max({$_[0]}))[0];
    my $max_length = (@sorted.max({$_[1]}))[1];
    my $line = "";
    my $pos = 0;
    for @sorted -&gt; $item {
        if $item[0] &lt; $current {
            say $line;
            $pos = 0;
            $line = "";
            $current--;
        }
        while $item[0] &lt; $current {
            say "$current |"; 
            $current--;
        }
        $line = "$current |" and $pos = 0 if $line eq "";
        $line ~=  " " x ~ ($item[1] - $pos - 1) ~ "x";
        $pos = $item[1];        
    }
    say $line;
    while $current-- &gt; 0 { say "$current |" }; 
    say "_" x ($max_length + 3), "\n";
}
</code></pre>

<p>With the following set of points:</p>

<pre><code>(1,1), (2,2), (5,2), (3,3), (3,1), (2,7);
</code></pre>

<p>the procedure first reverse sorts the points as well as their individual coordinates:</p>

<pre><code>[(7 2) (3 3) (2 2) (2 5) (1 1) (1 3)]
</code></pre>

<p>This is the output of this subroutine:</p>

<pre><code>7 | x
6 |
5 |
4 |
3 |  x
2 | x  x
1 |x x
0 |
________
</code></pre>

<p>For finding the alignments, I used a <em>dispatch table</em> (<code>%directions</code>) defining four directions in which to move in order to find the next point: North, North-East, East, and South-East (the other four directions are just symmetric and are not necessary, since we will look for straight lines starting from every point in the set. We also build a <code>%point-hash</code> hash to store all points in the form of a string containing the abscissa and ordinate of every point (separated by a semi-colon). Then we loop over every point in the data set and loop over each of the four directions, and find in the hash whether there is a new point in that direction. We count the number of points found in that direction and keep track of the maximum count (<code>$max-count</code>).</p>

<pre><code>sub find-alignments (@points) {
    my %directions = (
        N  =&gt; { $^a, $^b + 1 },
        NE =&gt; { $^a + 1, $^b + 1 },
        E  =&gt; { $^a + 1, $^b },
        SE =&gt; { $^a + 1, $^b - 1 }
    );
    my %point-hash = map { "$_[0];$_[1]" =&gt; True }, @points;
    my $max-count = 0;
    for @points -&gt; $point {
        for %directions.keys -&gt; $dir {
            my $count = 1;
            my $p = %directions{$dir}(|$point);
            while %point-hash{"$p[0];$p[1]"} {
                $p = %directions{$dir}(|$p);
                $count++;
            }
            $max-count = $count if $count &gt; $max-count;
        }
    }
    say "Count: $max-count \n\n";          
}
</code></pre>

<p>Note that the code to find the alignments (i.e. to actually solve the task) contains only 22 code lines, and is thus shorter that the code to display the points (but it may be argued that it uses slightly more advanced techniques). </p>

<p>This is the full program:</p>

<pre><code>use v6;

my @tests = ((1,1), (2,2), (5, 5), (5,2), (3,3), (3,1), (2,7), (4, 4)), 
            ((1,1), (2,2), (3,1), (1,3), (5,3)),
            ((1,1), (4,2), (1,3), (2,2), (1,2), (5,1), (1,4));
for @tests -&gt; @points {
    display-points(@points);
    find-alignments(@points);
}

sub display-points (@points) {
    my @sorted = reverse sort 
        { $^a[0] &lt;=&gt; $^b[0] || $^b[1] &lt;=&gt; $^a[1] }, 
        map { $_.reverse }, @points;
    my $current = (@sorted.max({$_[0]}))[0];
    my $max_length = (@sorted.max({$_[1]}))[1];
    my $line = "";
    my $pos = 0;
    for @sorted -&gt; $item {
        if $item[0] &lt; $current {
            say $line;
            $pos = 0;
            $line = "";
            $current--;
        }
        while $item[0] &lt; $current {
            say "$current |"; 
            $current--;
        }
        $line = "$current |" and $pos = 0 if $line eq "";
        $line ~=  " " x ~ ($item[1] - $pos - 1) ~ "x";
        $pos = $item[1];        
    }
    say $line;
    while $current-- &gt; 0 { say "$current |" }; 
    say "_" x ($max_length + 3), "\n";
}

sub find-alignments (@points) {
    my %directions = (
        N  =&gt; { $^a, $^b + 1 },
        NE =&gt; { $^a + 1, $^b + 1 },
        E  =&gt; { $^a + 1, $^b },
        SE =&gt; { $^a + 1, $^b - 1 }
    );
    my %point-hash = map { "$_[0];$_[1]" =&gt; True }, @points;
    my $max-count = 0;
    for @points -&gt; $point {
        for %directions.keys -&gt; $dir {
            my $count = 1;
            my $p = %directions{$dir}(|$point);
            while %point-hash{"$p[0];$p[1]"} {
                $p = %directions{$dir}(|$p);
                 $count++;
            }
            $max-count = $count if $count &gt; $max-count;
        }
    }
    say "Count: $max-count \n\n";          
}
</code></pre>

<p>This program displays the following output:</p>

<pre><code>$ raku max-points.raku

<h3>Max Points in Perl</h3>

<p>This is a port of the Raku program into Perl. Note that, for the sake of brevity, I will not show here the <code>display_points</code> subroutine as it is very similar to the equivalent code in Raku and is not very interesting. The test data sets are the same as in the Raku program, so you can look above to see the graphical representations of the point clouds. The <code>find_alignments</code> subroutine is similar to its counterpart in Raku and also uses a dispatch table with four directions in which to move to find the next point. Please refer to the Raku section above is you need additional explanations.</p>

<pre><code>use strict;
use warnings;
use feature "say";

my @tests = ( [[1,1], [2,2], [5, 5], [5,2], [3,3], [3,1], [2,7], [4, 4]], 
              [[1,1], [2,2], [3,1], [1,3], [5,3]],
              [[1,1], [4,2], [1,3], [2,2], [1,2], [5,1], [1,4]],
            );
for my $point_set (@tests) {
    # display_points(@points);
    find_alignments(@$point_set);
}

sub find_alignments  {
    my @points = @_;
    my %directions = (
        N  =&gt; sub { $_[0]-&gt;[0]    ,  $_[0]-&gt;[1] + 1 },
        NE =&gt; sub { $_[0]-&gt;[0] + 1,  $_[0]-&gt;[1] + 1 },
        E  =&gt; sub { $_[0]-&gt;[0] + 1,  $_[0]-&gt;[1]     },
        SE =&gt; sub { $_[0]-&gt;[0] + 1,  $_[0]-&gt;[1] - 1 }
    );
    my %point_hash = map { my @a = @$_; "$$_[0];$$_[1]" =&gt; 1 } @points;
    my $max_count = 0;
    for my $point (@points) {
        for my $dir (keys %directions) {
            my $count = 1;
            my @p = $directions{$dir}-&gt;($point);
            while ($point_hash{"$p[0];$p[1]"}) {
                @p = $directions{$dir}-&gt;([@p]);
                $count++;
            }
            $max_count = $count if $count &gt; $max_count;
        }
    }
    say  join " ", map { "(@{$_})" } @points;
    say "Count: $max_count \n";         
}
</code></pre>

<p>This program displays the following results:</p>

<pre><code>$ perl  max-points.pl
(1 1) (2 2) (5 5) (5 2) (3 3) (3 1) (2 7) (4 4)
Count: 5

(1 1) (2 2) (3 1) (1 3) (5 3)
Count: 3

(1 1) (4 2) (1 3) (2 2) (1 2) (5 1) (1 4)
Count: 4
</code></pre>

<h2>Task 2: Sum Path</h2>

<p><em>You are given binary tree containing numbers 0-9 only.</em></p>

<p><em>Write a script to sum all possible paths from root to leaf.</em></p>

<p><em>Example 1:</em></p>

<pre><code>Input:
     1
    /
   2
  / \
 3   4

Output: 13
as sum two paths (1-&gt;2-&gt;3) and (1-&gt;2-&gt;4)
</code></pre>

<p><em>Example 2:</em></p>

<pre><code>Input:
     1
    / \
   2   3
  /   / \
 4   5   6

Output: 26
as sum three paths (1-&gt;2-&gt;4), (1-&gt;3-&gt;5) and (1-&gt;3-&gt;6)
</code></pre>

<h3>Sum Path in Raku</h3>

<p>For this task, I also used a <code>display</code> subroutine, which uses itself a <code>bft</code> (breadth-first traversal) recursive subroutine, but that&#8217;s not what was asked in the task and I have already covered that, so I&#8217;ll omit that from this post (see <a href="http://blogs.perl.org/users/laurent_r/2020/04/perl-weekly-challenge-57-tree-inversion-and-shortest-unique-prefix.html">this blog post</a> for an example), and only detail the <code>dfs</code> (depth-first search) recursive subroutine which does the work of going through all the path through the tree. The <code>new-sum</code> variable keep tasks of the total sum so far through the path and, when we reach a leaf (no subtree), we update the <code>$*total-sum</code>. </p>

<pre><code>use v6;

my @tests = [1, [2, [3,], [4,]]], 
            [1, [2, [4,]], [3, [5], [6]]],
            [5, [4, [3, [7], [2]]], [8, [2], [9, [1]]]];

for @tests -&gt; @tree {
    my $*total-sum = 0;
    say @tree;
    dfs(@tree, 0);
    say $*total-sum;
}

sub dfs (@node, $sum-so-far) {
    my $new-sum = $sum-so-far + @node[0];
    unless @node[1]:exists or @node[2]:exists {
        $*total-sum += $new-sum;
        return;
    }
    dfs(@node[1], $new-sum) 
        if defined @node[1];
    dfs(@node[2], $new-sum)
        if defined @node[2];
}
</code></pre>

<p>This produces the following output:</p>

<pre><code>$ raku sum-path.raku
[1 [2 [3] [4]]]
13
[1 [2 [4]] [3 [5] [6]]]
26
[5 [4 [3 [7] [2]]] [8 [2] [9 [1]]]]
71
</code></pre>

<h3>Sum Path in Perl</h3>

<p>This is a port to Perl of the Raku program above, also with a <code>dfs</code> (depth-first search) recursive subroutine.</p>

<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/perl
use strict;
use warnings;
use feature qw/say/;

my @tests = ( [1, [2, [3,], [4,]]], 
              [1, [2, [4,]], [3, [5], [6, ]]],
              [5, [4, [3, [7], [2]]], [8, [2], [9, [1]]]]
            );
my $total_sum;
for my $tree (@tests) {
    $total_sum = 0;
    dfs($tree, 0);
    say $total_sum;
}

sub dfs {
    my ($node, $sum_so_far) = @_;
    my $new_sum = $sum_so_far + $node-&gt;[0];
    unless (exists $node-&gt;[1] or exists $node-&gt;[2]) {
        $total_sum += $new_sum;
        return;
    }
    dfs($node-&gt;[1], $new_sum) 
        if defined $node-&gt;[1];
    dfs($node-&gt;[2], $new_sum)
        if defined $node-&gt;[2];
}
</code></pre>

<p>This yields the same results as the Raku program:</p>

<pre><code>$ perl sum-path.pl
13
26
71
</code></pre>

<h2>Wrapping up</h2>

<p><strong>Lets wipe out the memory of 2020</strong></p>

<p><strong>Am I bitter about 2020?</strong></p>

<p>No, not at all. I like to find happiness in every little things in life. It is an art that I am still learning. I am writing this as a part of my monthly routine sharing last month activities. However this is special as it also has overall annual report of the year 2020.</p>

<p>I am embarassed looking back what I had planned at the start of the year. </p>

<p><strong>Do I have any plan for 2021?</strong></p>

<p>No way, I am not going to repeat my mistake. For a change, I want to see how I deal with my life without any plan.</p>

<p>I am a religious person, at least I like to believe I am. In the past, when ever I feel low, I seek guidance from <strong>ALLAH</strong> s.w.t. Believe it or not, I have been very lucky every time. It brings me closer to <strong>ALLAH</strong> s.w.t. The hardship of 2020 did the same to me. Working from home helped a lot, I feel blessed to have very understanding manager and colleagues.</p>

<p>The highlights of 2020 is the growth of <a href="https://perlweeklychallenge.org/">The Weekly Challenge</a>. I had incredible support and encouragement from each and every member of <strong>Team PWC</strong>. I would like to take this opportunity to thank, <strong>Pete Sergeant</strong> of <a href="https://perl.careers/">Perl Careers</a>, for the generosity and sponsoring the prize money. I am happy to announce that <strong>Pete</strong> agreed to continue in the year 2021 as well.</p>

<p>I am blessed to have the guidance and support by many big names of the Perl Community. First name is, <strong>Neil Bowers</strong>, I have even had the honour to work with him. He always encouraged me to push my boundaries. He is the one who encouraged me to give talk at <strong>London Perl Workshop</strong>. Before that I had zero experience in presenting talks. Now after so many years, I have given talks at various Perl Conference across Europe. There is one more person who shaped my growth and he is <strong>Gabor Szabo</strong>. Funny, I have never met him personally. I still remember my first interaction with him when he asked me if I am interested in giving interview. That interview changed me completely. I remember one incident, when <strong>Gabor</strong> offered to be my partner-in-crime while contributing to <strong>Dancer2</strong> project. It was great experience working together as remote pair-programming. Final nail in the coffin was when I became co-editor of <a href="https://perlweekly.com/">Perl Weekly</a> newsletter. I really gave him hard time first few weeks and but then with his help I understood the nitty-gritty of being a co-editor. Today, I am the co-editor with the most editions after him. It is a big deal for me. At the start of Dec 2020, Gabor, offered me to collaborate in one of his project. What a shame, I haven't completed the draft. I hope to get it done soon, sorry <strong>Gabor</strong>.</p>

<p>I would like to mention another name who helped me in my journey and he is <strong>brian d foy</strong>. I came to know him when I published my first module <a href="https://metacpan.org/release/Test-Excel">Test::Excel</a>. I had email interaction with him, as he is one of the <strong>PAUSE</strong> admin. Like <strong>Gabor</strong>, I haven't met <strong>brian d foy</strong> as well but I have always followed his work and contributions. I would like to thank him for giving away his pet project of doing monthly interview series for <a href="https://www.perl.com/">Perl.com</a>. It was an honour that he felt that I am capable to handle it. With his help and <strong>David Farrell</strong>, the editor of Perl.com, I have done 3 interviews with <a href="https://www.perl.com/article/the-perl-ambassador-gabor-szabo/">Gabor Szabo</a>, <a href="https://www.perl.com/article/the-perl-ambassador-curtis-poe/">Curtis 'Ovid' Poe</a> and <a href="https://www.perl.com/article/the-perl-ambassador-damian-conway/">Damain Conway</a>. Because of some personal reason, there have been some delay in the follow up interviews. Having said that I promise to be back with another interview soon. In fact I am in conversation with two big names. Things are moving but slowly. </p>

<p>As you all know, my spare time mostly devoted to my current love, <a href="https://perlweeklychallenge.org/">The Weekly Challenge</a>. It all started to bring <strong>Perl</strong> to the discussion table. While doing so, we brought <strong>Raku</strong> along as well. The <strong>Raku</strong> had positive influence and changed the project name, originally, it was called "<strong>Perl Weekly Challenge</strong>". Thanks to the elite members of <strong>Team PWC</strong>, we didn't limit ourself to just <strong>Perl</strong> and <strong>Raku</strong>. As of today, we have contributions in <strong>50</strong> different languages.<strong> Python</strong> top the list and is the most favourite language among the team. I would like to take this opportunity to thank all the reviewers, current and past. <strong>Kian-Meng Ang</strong> (Perl), <strong>Laurent Rosenfeld</strong> (Perl/Raku), <strong>Ryan Thompson</strong> (Perl/Raku), <strong>Colin Crain</strong> (Perl), <strong>Andrew Shitov</strong> (Raku).</p>

<p>I finally got the courage to take part in the weekly challenge. I must confess it wasn't easy as I already running short of time. Doing both tasks in <strong>Perl</strong> and <strong>Raku</strong> was time consuming. <strong>Raku</strong> being new to me took most time. Then on top of that I started blogging about my solutions. As I always do, I added additional work, live video of weekly solutions of <strong>Perl</strong> and <strong>Raku</strong>. </p>

<p><strong>You would think, I would stop there?</strong></p>

<p>Nope, I started contributing in <strong>Swift</strong>, another language that I adopted recently. You can imagine my work load at this point. I was doing this every week. Then came a point when I had to reduce the work load as it was affecting me. I stopped doing live video. Then I stopped doing weekly blog. Few weeks later, I stopped participating completely. </p>

<p><strong>Sad Ending?</strong></p>

<p>I am positive that in the new year 2021, I would be back but this time it is going to be slow and steady.</p>

<p>I would like to talk about another casualty of year 2020. <strong>Hacktoberfest</strong> and <strong>24PullRequest</strong> have been very close to me ever since I participated. For years, I enjoyed every little contributions I was able to do so. Last year, I barely managed to complete the <strong>Hacktoberfest</strong> challenge. I knew <strong>24PullRequest</strong> challenge is going to be difficult as I was busy doing <a href="https://perlweeklychallenge.org/blog/advent-calendar-2020/">The Weekly Challenge Advent Calendar</a>. I promise to take part in the annual event with full energy in <strong>2021</strong>. </p>

<p>Enough of sad story, I would like to mention project <a href="https://pullrequest.club/hello">Pull Request Club</a>, run by <strong>Kivanc Yazan</strong>. I have been associated with the project from the beginning. It has now completed <strong>2 years</strong> in <strong>Dec 2020</strong>. Congratulations <strong>Kivanc Yazan</strong>. I am happy to say that I have never missed a single assignment ever. So in the last <strong>2 years</strong> of my association, I have submitted <strong>24 Pull Requests</strong>. Of those, <strong>13 Pull Requests</strong> have been accepted and merged. So the success rate is more than <strong>50%</strong>.</p>

<p><img src="http://blogs.perl.org/users/mohammad_s_anwar/pr-club-summary.png"/></p>

<p>Contributing to <strong>CPAN</strong> modules is one of my favourite project. It started with the "<strong>Pull Reqest Challenge</strong>" ran by <strong>Neil Bowers</strong>. When <strong>Neil</strong> decided to stop the project in Dec 2015, I was very sad. It was working as catalyst for me. As I am always running short of time, it affected the time I used to spend on submitting PR every month. I have managed to submit one PR every day on average every month for many months. I would like to mention one such special  month, <strong>December 2018</strong>, when I submitted <strong>173 Pull Requests</strong> in just one month. </p>

<p><strong>Can you guess, how many PR I submitted in the entire year 2020?</strong></p>

<p><strong>106</strong> is the number, I am not proud of. </p>

<p>Lets change the subject slightly to make it look better, I have submitted <strong>2349 Pull Requests</strong> to <strong>CPAN</strong> modules till date. Of those, <strong>1703 Pull Requests</strong> have been accepted and merged. The success rate is <strong>72%</strong>. Not a bad attempt. While doing so, I made many friends. I have had many encouraging response, which is priceless.</p>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Originally published &lt;a href="https://xtrp.io/blog/2020/12/31/three-quick-programs-to-compute-trig-functions-in-python-javascript-perl-with-maclaurintaylor-series/"&gt;here at xtrp.io&lt;/a&gt;, my blog about computer science and just about anything programming.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#introduction" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Introduction
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have you ever wondered how your computer calculates certain mathematical functions, like division, or trigonometric functions like sine or cosine? Well, for some of these mathematical functions, there exist useful formulas to calculate very accurate results pretty easily. For sine and cosine, one commonly used formula looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--2C54cIXw--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://xtrp.io/api/content/static_files/three-quick-programs-to-compute-trig-functions-in-python-javascript-perl-with-maclaurintaylor-series/sinseries.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--2C54cIXw--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://xtrp.io/api/content/static_files/three-quick-programs-to-compute-trig-functions-in-python-javascript-perl-with-maclaurintaylor-series/sinseries.jpg" alt="Maclaurin Series of sin(x)"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And for cosine:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--G-WfBO9b--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://xtrp.io/api/content/static_files/three-quick-programs-to-compute-trig-functions-in-python-javascript-perl-with-maclaurintaylor-series/cosseries.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--G-WfBO9b--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://xtrp.io/api/content/static_files/three-quick-programs-to-compute-trig-functions-in-python-javascript-perl-with-maclaurintaylor-series/cosseries.jpg" alt="Maclaurin Series of cos(x)"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that the input of each function is in radians, not degrees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The series used in both formulas is called a &lt;a href="https://mathworld.wolfram.com/TaylorSeries.html"&gt;Maclaurin series&lt;/a&gt; (a type of &lt;a href="https://mathworld.wolfram.com/MaclaurinSeries.html"&gt;Taylor series&lt;/a&gt;), and can be derived from the sine and cosine functions with a series expansion. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#how-the-programs-work" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  How the Programs Work
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've written programs to implement these two computations in three major scripting languages: Python, JavaScript, and Perl. These programs do not include any built-in trig functions or other utilities except the use of the in-built π constant in some cases. All code is CC0 licensed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The approach I used creates a generalized function called &lt;code&gt;computeSeries&lt;/code&gt; which takes in x as the number to calculate the sine or cosine of, a starting number in the series (x for sine and 1 for cosine), and the exponent and factorial base in the first term of the series (3 for sine and 2 for cosine).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In calculating each series, I found that only about 10 terms in the series were needed to get a decently accurate result. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The programs additionally include utility functions for sine and cosine functions in degrees. The end of each program also includes a few tests of each function, which work as expected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#in-python" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  In Python
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Feel free to &lt;a href="https://gist.github.com/xtrp/2a5f0d82cff8c14867dabd22e0209933"&gt;view the below code as a GitHub Gist&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;math&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;pi&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# round a number (x) to nearest 10 digits
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;rounded&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;round&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# get the factorial of a number (x)
# factorial(x) is the product of every number from 1 to N inclusive
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;factorial&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;n&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# n is the result
&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# multiply n by every number from 1 to x inclusive
&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;range&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;n&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;n&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="s"&gt;""" get the result of the cos and sin formulas

&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;computeSeries&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;i_start&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;

  Conclusion
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope this helps in understanding how computers and languages would go about calculating trigonometric functions like sine and cosine. If you'd like to read more about how exactly mathematical formulas used to calculate the trig functions are derived, I would recommend taking a look at &lt;a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/math/old-ap-calculus-bc/bc-series"&gt;the videos on Taylor and Maclaurin series&lt;/a&gt; by Khan Academy.&lt;/p&gt;

<p>Task statement:</p>

<blockquote>TASK #1 › Isomorphic Strings
Submitted by: Mohammad S Anwar

<p>You are given two strings $A and $B.</p>

<p>Write a script to check if the given strings are Isomorphic. Print 1 if they are otherwise 0.<br />
Example 1:</p>

<p>Input: $A = "abc"; $B = "xyz"<br />
Output: 1</p>

<p>Example 2:</p>

<p>Input: $A = "abb"; $B = "xyy"<br />
Output: 1</p>

<p>Example 3:</p>

<p>Input: $A = "sum"; $B = "add"<br />
Output: 0<br />

     <p>Learning Perl programming is a rewarding experience. But equally tough without the right support. What would be useful to you as part of your learning and development?</p>

<p>Examples of how you might need support include:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Developers moving into Perl needing to bounce around ideas and code snippets in order to translate the concepts they have learnt in other languages into Perl.</p></li>
<li><p>Complete novices who have only just entered the programming world and have chosen Perl as their first dip into the water, looking for advice on where to start.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Without encouragement, guidance, even mentorship, we realise newcomers could quickly lose their enthusiasm and motivation for Perl. We know that support levels across the community vary and that it might not always be easy for newcomers to get help. We want to learn from your experiences and understand your needs so we can help fill the gaps.</p>

<p>A primary reason for this, is that so often Perl is denigrated by those who do not realise just how crucial it is. Maybe you are new to the team and have been given the ‘pile of Perl to fix’? So often we hear of new Perl developers being given the ‘messy’ jobs on legacy systems whilst the experienced developers go off to work on new ‘exciting’ projects.</p>

<p>But think about this. If we switched Perl off today, there would be a problem. A huge problem! We know that Perl is the glue that holds a lot of the IT world together. The Perl Foundation wants to support the community to make sure that the IT world doesn’t fall apart and supporting people learning Perl is a big element of that.</p>

<p>We have developed a survey that needs just a few minutes of your time, to tell us what you would like, or need, to support your move into, or progress within, the Perl language.</p>

<p>The survey will run throughout January with the results announced at <a href="https://fosdem.org/2021/">FOSDEM</a>.</p>

<p>Please <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/7YCL7JZ">complete the survey</a> today! TPF really wants to know what you need so we can help you succeed in Perl and help protect the systems depending on this critical programming language.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/7YCL7JZ"><img src="_ra-rel-mnt_/simplecas/fetch_content/496f7560e08fe40ef1b2d427f1920adb7e48886f/Take survey.jpg" style="max-width:100%;" /></a></p>

    <title>Weekly Challenge 093</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://dev.to/simongreennet/weekly-challenge-093-1dd9" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://perlweeklychallenge.org/blog/perl-weekly-challenge-093/"&gt;Challenge 093&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#task-1-max-points" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  TASK #1 › Max Points
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#task" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Task
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You are given set of co-ordinates &lt;code&gt;@N&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Write a script to count maximum points on a straight line when given co-ordinates plotted on 2-d plane.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#my-solution" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  My solution
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I broke this task into smaller parts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Read the input separate into an array of numbers, and make sure there are an even number of values. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Plot the points on into &lt;code&gt;@grid&lt;/code&gt; by taking 1 off each value. This makes the point &lt;code&gt;(0,0)&lt;/code&gt; the bottom right.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a graph. Although not part of the task, it's only four lines of code :)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Like with the &lt;a href="https://perlweeklychallenge.org/blog/perl-weekly-challenge-076/#TASK2"&gt;word search task&lt;/a&gt;, go through each point in four directions (up, right, diagonally up and right, diagonally down and right) and find the longest points from that starting point. There is no point going in the other four directions as they are just opposites of the above four.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Print the longest points to the screen.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#examples" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Examples
&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;» ./ch-1.pl "(1,1), (2,2), (3,3)"
|     x
|   x
| x
+ - - -

Output is: 3

» ./ch-1.pl "(1,1), (2,2), (3,1), (1,3), (5,3)"
|     x
|
| x
|   x
| x   x
+ - - -

Output is: 3
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel"&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action"&gt;
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#task-2-sum-path" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  TASK #2 › Sum Path
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#task" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Task
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You are given binary tree containing numbers &lt;code&gt;0-9&lt;/code&gt; only.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Write a script to sum all possible paths from root to leaf.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#my-solution" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  My solution
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This task was a little more complex than I expected. It didn't help that I had a little bug in my code that took me a while to figure out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though my solution is 64 lines long, it is pretty straight forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;First I read the input from STDIN.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The core of the code is then recursively calling the &lt;code&gt;_walk_path&lt;/code&gt; sub routine storing the current path in the &lt;code&gt;@$this_path&lt;/code&gt; array. If we hit the end of a node (i.e. it has no children), then I add it to the &lt;code&gt;@$paths&lt;/code&gt; array.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finally I display the sum, and the paths we visited.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#examples" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Examples
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(using the examples from the website)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;» ./ch-2.pl &amp;lt; example-1.txt 
Output is 13
Paths: (1, 2, 3), (1, 2, 4)

» ./ch-2.pl &amp;lt; example-2.txt 
Output is 26
Paths: (1, 2, 4), (1, 3, 5), (1, 3, 6)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel"&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action"&gt;
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Autovivification in JavaScript</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://dev.to/a2triple/autovivification-in-javascript-3c5p" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Autovivification is a very long and idiosyncratic word, which simply means that each time you dereference an undefined value, automatically an object is created in it's place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hmm... that wasn't very clear, was it? Let see an example to get the idea, trust me it's quite simple 😊&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In JavaScript you can easily do this&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;non_vivified&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{};&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;non_vivified&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;prop&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel"&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action"&gt;
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;but can not do this&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;non_vivified&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{};&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;non_vivified&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;parent_prop&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;child_prop&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Uncaught&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;TypeError&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;non_vivified&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;parent_prop&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;undefined&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel"&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action"&gt;
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And this is the case in the vast majority of programming languages. We usually prefer this approach as the latter is considered the less expected behavior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now one place where this is not the case is in &lt;code&gt;Perl&lt;/code&gt;. Perl has autovivification by default and is by far the most popular example of this property (even the picture on this post shows it).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OK, now let's get back to JavaScript. Where would we like such behavior to be present 🤔 Well the most obvious answer is when you want to dynamically create big nested structures as it would save you the hassle of checking if the property exists on each step and creating it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alright we are almost there now, how do we add autovivification to our js objects. It's actually quite simple, we use the &lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Proxy"&gt;Proxy&lt;/a&gt; object that was added in ES6. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's first see the code and work backwards.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;autovivify&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Proxy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({},&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;target&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;===&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;toJSON&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;target&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;target&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;?&lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;target&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;target&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;autovivify&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel"&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action"&gt;
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What we just did is create a function that returns a new instance of a vivified object. The important part is the second object passed to the Proxy constructor. It's basically an object that describes the handlers of the Proxy. As you guessed &lt;code&gt;get&lt;/code&gt; is the handler that is invoked when we request a property of the object. In our case if it does not exist we simply create a new Proxy object by recursively calling the &lt;code&gt;autovivify&lt;/code&gt; function. If it exists, then simply return the property. The other important thing is the &lt;code&gt;toJSON&lt;/code&gt; check. This is done so that we do not get a stack overflow error when calling &lt;code&gt;JSON.stringify&lt;/code&gt; as this is the method being called when serialization happens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we can do&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;vivified&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;autovivify&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;vivified&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;parent_prop&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;child_prop&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel"&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action"&gt;
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This is all nice and fine, but what if I want to vivify an already existing object. Well that is somewhat harder than expected, as we want proxies to be invisible to the caller. Or as the ES spec describes it&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;"It is impossible to determine whether an object is a proxy or not (transparent virtualization)."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your best bet would be to traverse the object, create a vivified object for each object in the source and when you hit a leaf, i.e a non object value just assign it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of this is best explained with some code.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// for convenience here, make the autovivify function accept a starting object as well&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;autovivify&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;obj&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{})&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Proxy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;obj&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// copy from the source&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;vivify&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;source&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// isArray and isObject are simple utils&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;result&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;util&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;isArray&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;source&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;autovivify&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;([])&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;autovivify&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;key&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;source&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;util&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;isObject&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;source&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]))&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="nx"&gt;result&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;vivify&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;source&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;])&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="nx"&gt;result&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;source&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;result&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel"&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action"&gt;
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now you can do stuff like&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;vivified&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;vivify&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;p1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;p2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;vivified&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// { p1: { p2: [] } }&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;vivified&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;p1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;p2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// []&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;vivified&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;p1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;p3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;p4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;p5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;p6&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// create a new deep property assignment&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;vivified&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;p1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;p3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;p4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;p5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;p6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// 2&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel"&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action"&gt;
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;An important limitation/feature here is that if you once assign a value to a property, vivification will not kick in as intended. For example:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;v&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;autovivify&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;v&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;p1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;p2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;v&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;p1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;p2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;p3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;p4&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Uncaught&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;TypeError&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Cannot&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;set&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;property&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;p4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;of&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;undefined&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel"&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action"&gt;
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Overall vivification is a strange property to most non &lt;code&gt;Perl&lt;/code&gt; developers that with a little proxy magic can be achieved in JavaScript as well. Use it wisely...&lt;/p&gt;

     <p>I am pleased to announce the launch of the <a href="https://www.perlfoundation.org/perl-core-development-fund.html">Perl Core Development Fund</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.perlfoundation.org/perl-5-core-maintenance-fund.html">Perl 5 Core Maintenance Fund</a> was launched in 2008 to support the development of the Perl programming language. Since then, we have awarded USD 670,000.</p>

<p>With the version change of the language, we will close the Perl 5 Core Maintenance Fund and launch the Perl Core Development Fund.</p>

<p>For those who would like to apply for grants, please take a look at the fund description.</p>

<p>Notable changes from the previous fund are:
- The fund is managed by the Grants Committee instead of the TPF Board.
- The Perl Steering Council is involved in the approval process.</p>

<p>I would like to thank those who provided valuable inputs in launching the fund, namely: the TPF Board members, Dave Mitchell, Tony Cook, Jason Crome and Matthias Bloch.</p>

<p>As always, thanks to our donors, both large and small, who support these funds.</p>

  Get to know about Simon Green
</h1>

<p>Welcome to the monthly series <code>Meet The Champion</code>.</p>

<p>Last month we spoke to <strong>Andrew Shitov</strong>, the winner of <strong><a href="https://perlweeklychallenge.org/blog/meet-the-champion-2020-10">October 2020</a></strong>.</p>

<p>Today we are talking to <strong>Simon Green</strong>, the winner of <strong>November 2020</strong> of <code>The Weekly Challenge</code>. I hope you are going to enjoy the interview.</p>




<p><strong>Mohammad:</strong> Tell us about your technical background?</p>

<p><strong>Simon:</strong> I've always had an interest in software development, even as a kid on an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amstrad_CPC">Amstrad CPC 664</a>. The specs were 360kB floppy disk, 64kB RAM, 4 MHz CPU. How did we ever survive? :P</p>

<p>After high school I worked on the helpdesk at an ISP. This was in 1995 when you had to explain to your parents what the Internet was.</p>




<p><strong>Mohammad:</strong> How/When did you start using <strong>Perl</strong>?</p>

<p><strong>Simon:</strong> Within a year of starting at the ISP, I moved to the programming team which was my first introduction to Perl. Since then Perl has been the main programming language in my jobs, although I am using Python a lot more now too.</p>

<p>I've also had an interest in System Administration, and obtained an RHCSA while working at Red Hat. More recently I'm a huge fan of Dev Ops, including Automation, Docker and CI/CD, etc.</p>




<p><strong>Mohammad:</strong> How did you come to know about <code>The Weekly Challenge</code>?</p>

<p><strong>Simon:</strong> I didn't actually start doing the challenge until week 68. I have subscribed to Gabor's (and others) <a href="https://perlweekly.com/">Perl Weekly Newsletter</a> since issue 13. The newsletter always had recaps of the previous challenges, and I decided it was time to join in on the fun.</p>




<p><strong>Mohammad:</strong> What do you like the most about <code>The Weekly Challenge</code>?</p>

<p><strong>Simon:</strong> Two things.</p>

<ol>
<li>Solving the tasks. Some are pretty straight forward and others require a bit of thought before I put fingers on the keyboard. This <a href="https://perlweeklychallenge.org/blog/perl-weekly-challenge-092/">week</a> is a classic example. The first task took about 10 minutes to write and test. The second task took a tad over an hour and a bit of trial and error.</li>
<li>Reading other people's solutions, especially those that have a blog post.</li>
</ol>




<p><strong>Mohammad:</strong> How much time you dedicate every week to <code>The Weekly Challenge</code>?</p>

<p><strong>Simon:</strong> For completing the tasks and blog, about one to 2 hours each week, usually on a Monday evening. I also usually spend about half an hour on Sunday looking at other solutions and blog posts.</p>




<p><strong>Mohammad:</strong> Do you checkout others solutions and who is your favourite?</p>

<p><strong>Simon:</strong> I do, but never before I submit my own solution. It doesn't seem fair to single out a few people, but I really love Abigail's solution and his blog posts (which are always excellent reading), and Roger Bell West usually has solutions very similar (or better) to my own.</p>

<p>I also occasionally read the Ruku solutions to see how crazy insane some of the syntax is, and Python solutions to sharpen my Python knowledge.</p>




<p><strong>Mohammad:</strong> What do you suggest someone just started <code>The Weekly Challenge</code>?</p>

<p><strong>Simon:</strong> Just do it. There are no right or wrong answers. You don't need to do both tasks, and some beginners might prefer to do just the first task (which is usually easier). I've also read there is a Perl mentor group on Facebook. I'm not on Facebook, so I don't know the details.</p>




<p><strong>Mohammad:</strong> Anything else you would to like to share with us?</p>

<p><strong>Simon:</strong> A huge thank you to yourself for the time you spend each week setting the challenge and handling commits and merge requests. A big thank you to <a href="//mailto:pwc.perfectwave@gmail.com">Colin Crane</a> for doing the weekly Perl Review. Also a thanks to the <a href="https://perl.careers/">Perl Careers</a> team for the reward.</p>

<p>And finally a thank you and appreciation to every single Team PWC member who submits solutions each week.</p>




<p>That brings the end of the conversation with <strong>Simon Green</strong>. Please do let us know your view. We will come back next month with another champion.</p>

    <title>Replacing CPAN RT</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://perlhacks.com/2020/12/replacing-cpan-rt/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Two weeks ago, we learned that the <a href="https://log.perl.org/2020/12/rtcpanorg-sunset.html">CPAN Request Tracker was closing down early next year</a>. I proposed <a href="https://perlhacks.com/2020/12/rt-action-plan-for-cpan-authors/">a plan that CPAN authors could follow</a> to ensure that their users can still find somewhere to report bugs in modules (and, perhaps more importantly, to see what bugs have already been reported in modules).</p>
<p>But that’s only part of the problem. In fact, it’s probably a minor part of the problem. If you’re an active CPAN author, then you probably already knew about the impending closure and had already made plans to deal with it. It’s likely that you had already moved your bug tracking to a new system. At the very least, you now know what the problem is and are considering the best way to deal with it before next March.</p>
<p>The far larger problem is the thousands of distributions that aren’t owned by active CPAN authors. What are we going to do about those?</p>
<p>How big is the problem? Well, the site <a href="https://cpan.rocks/">cpan.rocks</a> displays stats about CPAN. One of the panels on its front page shows a summary of the bugtracker information in CPAN distribution. You’ll see that 24,873 distributions (that’s 66% of them) have no bugtracker information included in their metadata. That’ll be for a number of reasons. Some of them will be distributions that haven’t been updated since alternative bugtrackers were supported by CPAN (originally, it was just assumed that everyone used the CPAN RT); some of them will be because the authors don’t know how to add the required metadata; and some of them (including most of my distributions) are missing it because the author just hasn’t got round to adding it yet. There will, of course, be many more reasons.</p>
<p>Some people will have read the recent news and will be galvanised into doing something about it (I fall firmly into that category) but others (and I’d suggest that it’s a large majority) either won’t hear about the change or won’t care about it. And why should they care? They were generous enough to donate some of their code to CPAN at some point. They don’t have any obligation at all to carry on maintaining it after they’ve lost interest in whatever project led to them writing that software.</p>
<p>Take, for example, <a href="https://metacpan.org/release/Mail-Alias">Mail-Alias</a>. That was released by someone called Tom Zeltwanger twenty years ago. He released three versions over a period of two months and then stopped. Who knows why. When he last updated the module, the CPAN search engine didn’t support alternative bugtrackers, so he never considered adding one. And that meant that the CPAN page for his module linked to the default bugtracker set up for the distribution on the CPAN RT. In the last fifteen years, <a href="https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Dist/Display.html?Name=Mail-Alias">four bugs have been reported</a> against that module. But as Tom has moved on, nothing has been done about any of them. There are a lot of modules on CPAN in a similar situation.</p>
<p>But that leaves <a href="https://metacpan.org/">MetaCPAN</a> (the current CPAN search engine) with a problem. Where does it send people who want to report a bug against an inactive module?</p>
<p>You might think that it doesn’t matter. But I disagree. Maybe I think that Mail::Alias would be the perfect module for a project I’m working on. Even before I start using it, it’s useful to be able to browse any existing bugs to see how they might affect my use of the module. And if someone later comes along and wants to take over maintenance of the module, then it’s useful for them to see any bugs that have been raised during the hiatus when the module was unmaintained.</p>
<p>So, I’m a big fan of having a default bugtracker for CPAN modules – even for ones with inactive authors. Which leads us to the question of where should that be. And I have a suggestion.</p>
<p>A few years ago, Micheal Schwern and Olaf Alders set up <a href="https://github.com/gitpan">Gitpan</a>. It’s an organisation which has a Github repo for every distribution on CPAN. And those repos each have a commit for every release of those distributions. Here, for example, is <a href="https://github.com/gitpan/Mail-Alias">the repo for Mail-Alias</a> – and you can see the three commits for the three releases I mentioned above.</p>
<p>So I’d like to suggest Gitpan as a suitable place to use as a default bugtracker for CPAN distributions. There are a couple of problems:</p>
<ul>
<li>It looks like the auto-population of the commits stopped a few years ago. We’d need to work out how that works and catch up on the recent uploads.</li>
<li>None of the repos has the issue tracker turned on. But I expect that can be done with a relatively simple program that uses the GitHub API.</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, we also have the problem that some people object to using GitHub since it was taken over by Microsoft. But that’s fine, they can just point their bugtracker metadata to their preferred system.</p>
<p>The problem with the CPAN RT was that it needed too much maintenance – and the Perl NOC team is really overworked. Any self-hosted alternative seems likely to have the same problem eventually. So I’m all in favour of using a third-party alternative. And if you’re taking that route, then it makes sense (to me, at least) to use a third-party system that already has all (ok, most) of the repos set up.</p>
<p>I haven’t spoken to Schwern or Olaf about this, so I don’t know if there was some major problem that would stop this plan from working. But I think it’s worth looking at.</p>
