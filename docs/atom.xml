    <title>Release 1.52 of perl-workflow</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://dev.to/jonasbn/release-1-52-of-perl-workflow-37fn" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Yet another bug fix release of <a href="https://github.com/jonasbn/perl-workflow">Perl-Workflow</a> has been made <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Workflow">available on CPAN</a>.</p>

<p>The release addresses an issue introduced in release 1.51. Unfortunately that is a <em>side-effect</em> of changing code and progressing rapidly, but we located the issue fast and were able to patch it bundled with improved unit-tests, so this issue should not show up again, at least not in this form.</p>

<p>An update is recommended based on the above fix if you are using 1.51.</p>

<p>The many releases and traction has has resulted in some feedback and in <a href="https://dev.to/thorstenhirsch/comment/1b24d">a comment on dev.to</a> to the  <a href="https://dev.to/jonasbn/release-1-50-of-perl-workflow-2a1h">release 1.50 announcement</a> it was pointed out that the installation documentation mentioned files not available in the repository. The comment points to a very important part of open source consumption and that is you, the developer/maintainer, cannot expect users to have the same toolchain or environment as you. So you have to be clear on requirements and assumptions in your documentation.</p>

<p>The documentation has now been updated to explain as to how installation should is assumed done and more information on working with the toolchain used is added to the repository wiki. Thanks to Thorsten Hirsch for the feedback.</p>

<p>The change to the installation documention, also made way for a change to the toolchain and Perl-Workflow now no longer generates both a <code>Build.PL</code> and a <code>Makefile.PL</code>, since this is regarded as bad practice. Check the details in the change log below.</p>

<p>The release also contains corrections to some badly formatted URLs, thanks to Michiel W. Beijen for the PR. Apparently some maintainers are hesitant when it comes to contributions from <em>casual contibutors</em>, I am of the opposite camp, if somebody spots an issue in my repository, which I missed, I am very happy for received a notification or correction - then again me repositories are not heavy on traffic, my time is limited, but I am not in a situation where this has ever been a burden.</p>

    <title>To help Perl, just blog</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://dev.to/thibaultduponchelle/to-help-perl-just-blog-9h4" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;If you want to help Perl as a language, I would recommend to just blog 😃&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, having a powerful, smart, fast and non buggy language is great...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have it! Yeah!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having great modules is also key, but here also it is covered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--kJOyq-X8--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/1uwpdbunwe6u1wa1pmg4.jpeg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--kJOyq-X8--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/1uwpdbunwe6u1wa1pmg4.jpeg" alt="Awesome"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Technically speaking, Perl has limitations but no flaw.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--xZjop3eK--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/fvpq9cuzw8afn0phzisg.jpeg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--xZjop3eK--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/fvpq9cuzw8afn0phzisg.jpeg" alt="Fanboy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I'm not a fanboy (even if I wrote a &lt;a href="https://dev.to/thibaultduponchelle/a-perl-love-letter-20jj"&gt;Perl love letter&lt;/a&gt;), I recognize technical limitations like for instance the way CPAN clients can only install one version of a module at a time (Raku can do better) and that object oriented programming is not in the core. But each limitation can be easily circumvented or patched by modules or community rigorous behaviour. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some people can also judge it's not the most beautiful language, especially since some codebase were maintained by people that don't know (and don't want to invest in) Perl but it's a matter of taste.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have this problem at &lt;code&gt;$work&lt;/code&gt; with ruby codebase, so this problem is totally language agnostic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some people will argue that the "TIMTOWTDI" is a flaw, but it is certainly a quality also!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In term of tooling, Perl devs were visionaries but several great features from Perl world are now shared with other languages (continuous testing, modules, etc...). It is OK 😃 Perl does not play against others, neither does job protection. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The good old Perl loves everyone and is interoperable with everything...In its infinite kindness 😀&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--1ywyAQNU--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/hjzfz1zihw0om9dtdxq5.jpeg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--1ywyAQNU--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/hjzfz1zihw0om9dtdxq5.jpeg" alt="Amen"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The thing is, Perl has a bad reputation and is not very visible in usual channels. One being linked to the other (which one is the cause?).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I explain it because it is not in the DNA of Perl community. &lt;br&gt;
Perl devs are probably more attached to stability than hype.&lt;br&gt;
Perl devs are not blogging a lot, are not giving a lot of stars in GitHub and just prefer working pearls over shiny diamonds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So my answer is to make it a bit more visible and modern.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--QIGHHYOg--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/8tlyxtqooqto94krejwo.jpeg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--QIGHHYOg--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/8tlyxtqooqto94krejwo.jpeg" alt="Modern Perl"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Some people pushed for &lt;strong&gt;modern Perl&lt;/strong&gt; years ago and I think this initiative had a very good impact (and the eponymous book is a masterpiece).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Perl 7&lt;/strong&gt; announcement was also a huge success on this side, whatever the final implementation would be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My recommendation is about &lt;em&gt;blogging&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blogging takes time but is easy, fun and very rewarding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And at term it also extends your "reading list" since it creates a "scene" (the emulation makes others writing).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So if you want to help Perl as a language, I would recommend to just blog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And if not motivated/convinced, at least like/share/comment.&lt;br&gt;
And if you still don't care, enjoy and long live to you 😛&lt;br&gt;

        <![CDATA[<p>We are finally here - we have hit week 100 of Manwar's Perl Weekly Challenges, and here are solutions to this weeks challenges from the <a href="https://perlweeklychallenge.org/">Perl Weekly Challenge</a>.</p>

<p>You can find my full code on
<a href="https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/tree/master/challenge-100/james-smith/perl">Github</a></p>

<h3>Task 1: Fun time</h3>
You are given a time (12 hour / 24 hour). Write a script to convert the given time from 12 hour format to 24 hour format and vice versa. Ideally we expect a one-liner.

<pre>
Example 1: Input: 05:15 pm or 05:15pm -> Output: 17:15
Example 2: Input: 19:15               -> Output: 07:15 pm or 07:15pm
</pre>

<h4>The solution</h4>
Firstly I have to thank Manwar for asking for a one line solution as this is my <em>modus operandi</em>.... So we will look at this and see how we can get a simple yet compact solution... well here goes.... {code is 110 bytes, within the functions curly braces there are just 102 bytes of code}

<pre><code>
sub ft{pop=~s/(.+)(:..)\s*(.m|)/sprintf'%02d%s%s',
($1%12||(12*!$3))+12*('pm'eq$3),$2,$3?'':$1<12?'am':'pm'/re}
</code></pre>

<p>Let me try and explain the logic in this.</p>

<p>Firstly what is the smallest regex we can use to distinguish between 12 hour and 24 hour clock times (assuming that the value is either)</p>

<p>First pass we try <tt>/\A(\d\d):(\d\d)\s*([ap]m)?\Z/</tt>.</p>

<p>How can we simplify this?</p>

<ul>
  <li>We don't need to anchor the ends so we can remove the <tt>\A</tt> and <tt>\Z</tt></li>
  <li>** <tt>/(\d\d):(\d\d)\s*([ap]m)?/</tt></li>
  <li>We don't need to know that the numbers are numbers just they are of the form something-something-:-something-something, and we only need to know that we have something-m at the end if 12 hour clock</li>
  <li>** <tt>/(.+):(..)\s*([ap]m)?/</tt></li>
  <li>For later it would be useful if we captured the : with the minutes saves us a byte in the sprintf.</li>
  <li>** <tt>/(.+)(:..)\s*([ap]m)?/</tt></li>
  <li>Finally again for later we want don't want to check whether or not $3 exists we can re-write (.m)? as (.m|) to achieve this.</li>
  <li>** <tt>/(.+)(:..)\s*(.m|)/</tt></li>
</ul>

<p>So we end up with: <tt>/(.+)(:..)\s*(.m|)/</tt></p>

<p>Now for the replace logic.</p>

<ul>
  <li>For the hours: If 24 hour clock we reduce the number modulo 12 (but if it is 0 we use 12 instead)<br />We user "||" for this as if the first value is 0 we use the 2nd values...<br />
  <tt>$1%12||(12*!$3)</tt>
</li>
  <li>For the hours: If 12 hour clock we reduce the number module 12 (and add 12 if it is pm)<br /><tt>($1%12)+12*('pm'eq$3)</tt><br />We use a yoda condition to shorten the perl by putting the constant before the eq and the variable after we don't need a space between the variable name and the eq.</li>
  <li>For the minutes: Minutes stay the same</li>
  <li>For the suffix: If 12 hour clock we do nothing</li>
  <li>For the suffix: If &lt; 12 we return am o/w we return pm</li>
</ul>

<p>Other things</p>

<ul>
  <li>We use <tt>s///er</tt> to both evaluate a function based on the matches and return the replaced string</li>
  <li>One minor thing - rather than using shift to get the parameter passed we use pop as this is two bytes shorter</li>
</ul>

<pre><code>sub fun_time {
  return pop =~
    ## Note the nasty hack we pop rather than shift - that saves 2 bytes
    ## in our golfdom....
    s/
        ## Split into 3 parts, $1 - hours, $2 - minutes & $3 - am/pm
      (.+) (:..) \s* ( .m | )
        ## We assume all strings are valid - so we don't have to anchor
        ## at both ends or worry what the 12hr clock sufficies are
        ## am/pm and .m is shorter than [ap]m
        ##
        ## We assume that the time will always have a : followed
        ## 2 digits...
        ##
        ## Note if we right (.m)? the 3rd capture variable $3 is
        ## sometimes undefined - better is to use (.m|) which
        ## matches the same way but $3 is now an empty string not
        ## undefined when we have a 24 hour clock time
    /
      sprintf '%02d%s%s',
        ( $1 % 12 || ( 12 * ! $3 ) ) + 12 * ( 'pm' eq $3 ),
          ## Get hour modulo 12..
          ## From 24hr to 12hr clock we need to convert 00:?? to 12:??
          ## From 12hr to 24hr clock it is pm we then need to add 12...
          ## Note we use the "yoda condition" for the equals
          ##   'pm'eq$3
          ## as this is a byte shorter than the more usual way of
          ## writing inequalitys
          ##   $3 eq'pm'
          ## as we don't need a space between the $3 & the eq...
        $2,
          ## The minutes is the easy bit just copy..
        $3 ? '' : $1 < 12 ? 'am' : 'pm'
          ## If we are converting from 12hr clock the third string is
          ## empty - if not and the time is <12 we return am o/w  pm
    /rex;
}
</code></pre>

<h4>Some notes on <em>golfing</em></h4>

<ol>
<li>Doing everything inside the regex using <code>/re</code> modifiers... <code>/e</code> most people will know is "execute", <code>/r</code> is return the replacement - not replace in place.</li>
<li>Normally we would use <code>shift</code> to get the parameter of the subroutine, but in this case we know we have one parameter so we can use <code>pop</code> instead - saves 2 characters!</li>
<li>The regex isn't specific - we aren't really using it to match we are using it to extract characters from the parameter</li>
<li><code>!$var</code> - returns <code>1</code> if the <code>$var</code> is <code>''</code>/<code>undef</code>/<code>0</code>, <code>0</code> otherwise - in this case if we are converting to 12hr clock we don't tend to write 0:01am but 12:01am so we need to add <code>12</code> if the first number is <code>0</code> & match var <code>$3</code> is empty...</li>
<li>Talking of match var 3 most people would write <code>(.m|)</code> as <code>(.m)?</code> but if you are running under <code>use strict</code>/<code>use warnings</code> this throws an undefined variable warning... as <code>$3</code> is undefined if you don't match - on the other hand <code>(.m|)</code> returns a match or the empty string!</li>
<li>"<code>'pm'eq$3</code>" - a "yoda condition" - use it we do - to save a byte. If we wrote it the way you would expect to use "<code>$3 eq 'pm'</code>" you have to have a space between the "<code>3</code>" and the "<code>eq</code>" by writing it as a yoda condition you don't as you don't need a space between "<code>'</code>" and "<code>eq</code>" and "<code>eq</code>" and "<code>$</code>"</li>
<li>We could use another ternary here as well <code>('pm'eq$3?12:0)</code> but that would be longer... but we know the match returns <code>1</code> (true) or <code>0</code> (false) so we can just multiply...</li>
</ol>

<p>There will some more "golf" tricks in task 2.... Just a little note - if you are golfing then it is good to use TDD (Test Driven Design) and define tests so that you can make sure that the little tweaks - the removal of a symbol here or the tweak of the way a comparison is done - doesn't change the result. I use <code>Test::More</code> to define the tests.</p>

<h3>Task 2: Triangle sum</h3>
You are given triangle array. Write a script to find the minimum path sum from top to bottom. When you are on index i on the current row then you may move to either index i or index i + 1 on the next row.

<pre>
Example 1:
Input: Triangle = [ [1], [2,4], [6,4,9], [5,1,7,2] ]
Output: 8

<p>Explanation: The given triangle</p>

<p>            1<br />
           2 4<br />
          6 4 9<br />
         5 1 7 2</p>

<p>The minimum path sum from top to bottom:  1 + 2 + 4 + 1 = 8</p>

<p>             [1]<br />
           [2]  4<br />
           6 [4] 9<br />
          5 [1] 7 2<br />
Example 2:<br />
Input: Triangle = [ [3], [3,1], [5,2,3], [4,3,1,3] ]<br />
Output: 7</p>

<p>Explanation: The given triangle</p>

<p>            3<br />
           3 1<br />
          5 2 3<br />
         4 3 1 3</p>

<p>The minimum path sum from top to bottom: 3 + 1 + 2 + 1 = 7</p>

<p>             [3]<br />
            3  [1]<br />
           5 [2] 3<br />
          4 3 [1] 3<br />
</pre></p>

<h4>The solution</h4>
There are literally two directions you can go with this problem, quite literally up and down.

<p>The first thought is to go down - there is a relatively simple recursive solution and another which tries all paths - but these are effectively O(n2^n) complexity.</p>

<p>Then we can look at going up... We take off the last row of the triangle and merge it into the line before - adding to it the minimum of it's two "children". Repeating until we only have one cell. this is O(n^2) complexity.</p>

<p>Even for the examples here there is a considerable (4 fold) gain over the descent methods.</p>

<pre><code>sub triangle_sum {
  ## Make a deep copy as code is destructive
  my @tri = map { @{$_} } @_;
  while(@tri>1) {
      ## Strip off base of triangle...
    my $b = pop @tri;
      ## Update new last line by adding smallest of it's "children"
    $tri[-1][$_] += $b->[$b->[$_]<$b->[$_+1]?$_:$_+1] for 0..@tri-1;
  }
  return $tri[0][0];
}</code></pre>

<h4>Golfing the script</h4>

<p>Can we write this with less lines... yes - we can 'golf' this one - but as we weren't asked to - I thought I would add this as an aside...</p>

<p>To make this a 1 liner we will need a couple of "golf" tricks..</p>

<ol><li>We need to convert the inner <code>for</code> to a <code>map</code></li>
<li>We need remove the separate <code>$b = pop @tri</code> - we can move it into the <code>while</code> clause.</li>
<li>Here is a cool Perl fact - <code>$a</code> & <code>$b</code> can both be used with or without "<code>my</code>" in code even under use stricts - this is because they are "local" special variables - the two comparison variables used in <code>sort</code> blocks.
</li>
</ol>

<p>The code becomes:</p>

<pre><code>sub triangle_sum_1point5_liner {
  @_ = map { @{$_} } @_;
  @{$_[-1]} = map {
    $_[-1][$_] + $b->[ $b->[$_] < $b->[$_+1] ? $_ : $_+1 ]
  } 0..@_-1 while @{$b=pop @_}>1;
  $b->[0];
}</code></pre>

<p><strong>Note</strong> as we do the pop in the <code>while</code> clause we need to use <code>$b</code> rather than <code>$_[0]</code> (which no longer exists as we've already popped it off)</p>

<h4>Aside 2 - Displaying the path</h4>

<p>Although not asked it would be good to see if we could see the path through the triangle...</p>

<p>This is just really an extension of what we did in the first case - but as well as keeping the lowest total for each cell - we also keep a list of the nodes which generated that minimal sum.</p>

<p>As the code to get the route is destructive we first have to take a deep copy of the triangle passed in. The triangle can nicely be drawn in a single statement, by nested maps (note we do have to copy the outer loop <code>$_</code> into another variable - again we use the local special variables <code>$a</code>... We set it in the first part of the map array - in such a way it is hidden from the print.</p>

<p>Rather than concatenate - we just allow print to automatically concatenate all the strings. But there is a <em>gotcha</em> here - as we wrap the <code>map</code> in parentheses and <code>print</code> is a function, print will only display the contents of the parentheses, and ignore anything that follows.. To avoid this we need to make sure that the first symbol after the <code>print</code> is not an open parenthesis. To avoid this we start with the crucial <code>'',</code>. Other ways of doing this is, for a scalar is either <code>q().</code> or <code>0+</code> depending if you are returning a string or a number...</p>

<pre><code>sub display_sum {
  my @tri = map{ [@{$_}] } @_; ## Deep copy the triangle as the
                               ## search is destructive

<p>  my @route; ## For each node in the "current" bottom row, the route<br />
             ## is the list of indices of the child nodes that make<br />
             ## up the "optimal" path<br />
             ## We use the implicit my on $b<br />
 <br />
  while(@{$b = pop @tri}>1) {<br />
    ($tri[-1][$_],$route[$_]) = $b->[$_]<$b->[$_+1]<br />
      ? ( $tri[-1][$_] + $b->[$_],   [$_,  @{$route[$_  ]||[]}] )<br />
      : ( $tri[-1][$_] + $b->[$_+1], [$_+1,@{$route[$_+1]||[]}] )<br />
    foreach 0..@tri-1;<br />
  }</p>

<p>  @route = (0,@{$route[0]}); ## We need to add the top node index<br />
                             ## (always 0), at the same time we can<br />
                             ##  just take the first (only)<br />
                             ## path out of the 2d route matrix;</p>

<p>  print ## Assume all cell numbers are single digits...<br />
    '',<br />
    ( map {<br />
      '  ' x (@_-($a=$_)), ## use implicit my on $a;<br />
      ( map {<br />
        sprintf $route[$a]==$_ ? '[%d] ': ' %d  ' , $_[$a][$_]<br />
      } 0..$a ),<br />
      "\n"<br />
    } 0..@_-1 ),<br />
    "\nMinimum path: ",(join ' -> ', map {<br />
       $_[$_][$route[$_]] } 0..@_-1 ),' ; Total: ',$b->[0],"\n\n";</p>

<p>}</code></pre></p>

<p>Here is the output from the examples:</p>

<pre>        [1]
      [2]  4
     6  [4]  9
   5  [1]  7   2

<p>Minimum path: 1 -> 2 -> 4 -> 1 ; Total: 8</p>

<p>        [3]<br />
       3  [1]<br />
     5  [2]  3<br />
   4   3  [1]  3</p>

<p>Minimum path: 3 -> 1 -> 2 -> 1 ; Total: 7</p>

<p>        [3]<br />
      [3]  1<br />
    [3]  8   9<br />
   4  [3]  1   3</p>

<p>Minimum path: 3 -> 3 -> 3 -> 3 ; Total: 12<br />
</pre></p>

<p>The final one demonstrates that the minimal route does not always take the smallest value from each row. In the 2nd & 4th rows the chosen node is not the smallest - as to choose that you would also mean you would have to include the large 8 or 9 from the 3rd row.<br />

    <title>Better Perl: More on signatures and types</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://dev.to/mjgardner/better-perl-more-on-signatures-and-types-3i47" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>A few weeks ago I wrote an article covering <a href="https://phoenixtrap.com/index.php/2021/01/27/better-perl-with-subroutine-signatures-and-type-validation/">six ways to do subroutine signatures and type constraints in Perl</a>. Some of the feedback I got indicated that there were more options to consider, so for the <a href="https://phoenixtrap.com/index.php/2021/02/11/slides-from-tonights-houston-perl-mongers-presentation/">presentation I gave at Houston Perl Mongers</a> I quickly summarized at the end seven more modules from CPAN that offer these features. Still more feedback showed that I had missed five more modules, so at the risk of becoming “the signatures guy” here they are.</p>

<h2>
  <a href="#classparamparser-updated" class="anchor">
  </a>
  <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Class::ParamParser">Class::ParamParser</a> (updated)
</h2>

<p>First released in 2000 as part of a larger project, this may be the first general-purpose parameter parser to appear on CPAN. Although the documentation examples use it as a parent class, you should follow the suggestion further down and use its two methods <code>params_to_hash</code> and <code>params_to_array</code> directly from the class. Both take the same list of arguments, and only differ on whether they return a hash reference containing named parameters or an array reference containing positional parameters.</p>

<p>There are options for slurping extra passed values into another hash bucket and lowercasing named parameters, and it will automatically chop off any leading hyphens in your parameter names. You can also alias multiple named parameters to the same resulting argument. The module doesn't provide any facility for type validation, though.</p>

<h2>
  <a href="#methodparamvalidator" class="anchor">
  </a>
  <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Method::ParamValidator">Method::ParamValidator</a>
</h2>

<p>This adds the interesting wrinkle of being configurable with an external JSON file; otherwise, it seems you have to call various methods on a validator object to add parameters (which it calls <em>fields</em>) or methods to validate. It doesn’t seem to support slurping extra values nor positional parameters, but its type validation lets you use arbitrary code references. The documentation could use a bit of work with more examples of real-world usage rather than test script extracts. The author says it’s “just a prototype,” though.</p>

<h2>
  <a href="#mojoliciousvalidator" class="anchor">
  </a>
  <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Mojolicious::Validator">Mojolicious::Validator</a>
</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://mojolicious.org/">Mojolicious real-time web framework</a> has a built-in validator, but it’s geared towards <a href="https://docs.mojolicious.org/Mojolicious/Guides/Rendering#Form-validation">validating HTTP parameters</a> rather than subroutine arguments. There’s also a <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/MojoX::Validator">MojoX::Validator</a> wrapper for <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Input::Validator">Input::Validator</a> that performs much the same task. You could press either into service as subroutine validators if you’re already using Mojolicious, but they aren’t structured that way.</p>

<h2>
  <a href="#returntype" class="anchor">
  </a>
  <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Return::Type">Return::Type</a>
</h2>

<p>This isn’t for input parameters to subroutines; rather, it provides an attribute that specifies what type your subroutines <strong>return</strong>. As such, it’s complimentary to most of the other techniques covered in this series. It works with <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Type::Tiny">Type::Tiny</a>, <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/MooseX::Types">MooseX::Types</a>, or <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/MouseX::Types">MouseX::Types</a>, and because Perl functions can tell whether they’re in scalar or list context, you can specify different type constraints for each.</p>

<p>There are several other modules with similar functionality, but these are outside the scope of this article.</p>

<h2>
  <a href="#routines" class="anchor">
  </a>
  <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/routines">routines</a>
</h2>

<p>Based on <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Function::Parameters">Function::Parameters</a> (covered <a href="https://phoenixtrap.com/index.php/2021/01/27/better-perl-with-subroutine-signatures-and-type-validation/">previously</a>), this pragma adds support for a <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/registry">registry</a> for storing <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Type::Tiny">Type::Tiny</a> type libraries. It doesn’t appear to offer any other signature features, though. Feel free to correct me in the comments.</p>

<p>As I said in <a href="https://phoenixtrap.com/index.php/2021/02/11/slides-from-tonights-houston-perl-mongers-presentation/">my slide deck</a>, maybe we’re taking <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/There%27s_more_than_one_way_to_do_it">TMTOWTDI</a> too far? It’s nice to be spoiled for options, though. I still recommend <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Type::Tiny">Type::Tiny</a>’s <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Type::Params">Type::Params</a> for its performance and flexibility, or <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Params::ValidationCompiler">Params::ValidationCompiler</a> if you’re using type libraries from <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Specio">Specio</a> or <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Moose">Moose</a>. Some useful side-by-side benchmarks would be nice; maybe I’ll save that for another article and further risk being labeled “the signatures guy.”</p>

    <title>Perl programmers are Mandalorians</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://dev.to/thibaultduponchelle/perl-programmers-are-mandalorians-l0b" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--gr6txTwa--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/29ivqa7a5jg5o7uqz47n.jpeg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--gr6txTwa--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/29ivqa7a5jg5o7uqz47n.jpeg" alt="Mando and baby Yoda"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Perl programmers were a clan-based cultural group that was composed of members from multiple species all bound by a common culture, creed, and code. They originated on the planet Unix in the Outer Rim Territories and had a particularly important role in Internet history as legendary hackers/gurus.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Experienced Perl programmers are powerful and respected, but sometimes suffer from being rejected by other cultures that do not embrace Perl qualities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Perl masters were some of the most feared warriors in the galaxy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They are now spread all over the universe, sometimes exiled. They often prefer to stay discrete.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Dx1OOIZX--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/imley79qf9cfjdw9lpv2.jpeg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Dx1OOIZX--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/imley79qf9cfjdw9lpv2.jpeg" alt="Hide"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Perl programmers respect the creed:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;- sharing - portability - stability -&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--DoY0kl83--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/ac501qni64swgoukw64a.jpeg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--DoY0kl83--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/ac501qni64swgoukw64a.jpeg" alt="Creed"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When people meet a Perl programmer, they have a strange reaction then look at him and say "so you're one of them?"&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--OYwI6MPF--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/i3a2x62x9kibgj7m41qy.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--OYwI6MPF--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/i3a2x62x9kibgj7m41qy.png" alt="Never met real Mandalorian"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perl programmers are &lt;strong&gt;Mandalorians&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--VZQKKqA2--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/f2t0zisq4rqvobxq7evi.jpeg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--VZQKKqA2--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/f2t0zisq4rqvobxq7evi.jpeg" alt="Perl users are Mandalorians"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Setup Mojolicious using Vagrant</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://dev.to/akuks/setup-mojolicious-using-vagrant-3jg2" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In this article, we cover how to set up the Mojolicious development environment using the Vagrant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also cover:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Installation of VirtualBox&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Installation of Vagrant&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create Vagrantfile&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Execute vagrant&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#vagrant-introduction" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Vagrant Introduction
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Vagrant is a tool focused on giving a uniform development environment across different operating systems. It manages virtual machine environments and lowers the development environment setup time. It also helps in getting rid of the "&lt;strong&gt;works on my machine&lt;/strong&gt;" phrase commonly used by software developers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#installation" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Installation
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before installing Vagrant, we need to install VirtualBox on our operating systems. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are using MacOS,&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;brew update &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; brew upgrade
brew &lt;span class="nb"&gt;install &lt;/span&gt;virtualbox &lt;span class="c"&gt;# Virtualbox installation&lt;/span&gt;
brew &lt;span class="nb"&gt;install &lt;/span&gt;vagrant    &lt;span class="c"&gt;# Vagrant Installation&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel"&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action"&gt;
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On Debian/Ubuntu OS,&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;sudo &lt;/span&gt;apt update
&lt;span class="nb"&gt;sudo &lt;/span&gt;apt &lt;span class="nb"&gt;install &lt;/span&gt;virtualbox
&lt;span class="nb"&gt;sudo &lt;/span&gt;apt &lt;span class="nb"&gt;install &lt;/span&gt;vagrant
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel"&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action"&gt;
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On RHEL/CentOS&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;yum &lt;span class="nb"&gt;install &lt;/span&gt;virtualbox
yum &lt;span class="nb"&gt;install &lt;/span&gt;vagrant
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel"&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action"&gt;
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To verify that the installation, run the following command that will print the Vagrant version:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;vagrant &lt;span class="nt"&gt;--version&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel"&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action"&gt;
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;





&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c"&gt;#Output&lt;/span&gt;
Vagrant 2.2.14
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel"&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action"&gt;
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#getting-started" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Getting Started
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Setting up the vagrant is fairly easy. We need to create a new directory to setup the root of the application.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;mkdir &lt;/span&gt;vagrant_mojo
&lt;span class="nb"&gt;cd &lt;/span&gt;vagrant_mojo
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel"&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action"&gt;
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Setup the Vagrantfile&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;vagrant init
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel"&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action"&gt;
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Above command creates Vagrantfile in the current diretory i.e. &lt;strong&gt;vagrant_mojo&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c"&gt;#Output&lt;/span&gt;
A Vagrantfile has been placed &lt;span class="k"&gt;in &lt;/span&gt;this directory. You are now
ready to vagrant up your first virtual environment! Please &lt;span class="nb"&gt;read
&lt;/span&gt;the comments &lt;span class="k"&gt;in &lt;/span&gt;the Vagrantfile as well as documentation on
vagrantup.com &lt;span class="k"&gt;for &lt;/span&gt;more information on using Vagrant.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel"&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action"&gt;
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Clear all the content of the 'Vagrantfile'&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;Vagrant.configure&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"2"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;do&lt;/span&gt; |config|
    config.vm.box &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"generic/ubuntu2004"&lt;/span&gt;
    config.disksize.size &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'25GB'&lt;/span&gt;
    config.vm.network &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"forwarded_port"&lt;/span&gt;, guest: 80, host: 8080
    config.vm.network &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"forwarded_port"&lt;/span&gt;, guest: 443, host: 8443
    &lt;span class="c"&gt;# Can access 3000 port from parent OS&lt;/span&gt;
    config.vm.network &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"forwarded_port"&lt;/span&gt;, guest: 3000, host: 3000

    &lt;span class="c"&gt;# mysql&lt;/span&gt;
  config.vm.network &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"forwarded_port"&lt;/span&gt;, guest: 3306, host: 30306

  &lt;span class="c"&gt;# If you are using postgres uncheck this&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="c"&gt;# config.vm.network "forwarded_port", guest: 5432, host: 54320&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="c"&gt;# For SSH&lt;/span&gt;
  config.ssh.forward_agent &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="c"&gt;# Current folder is synced with the Vagrant VM /vagrant_data directory&lt;/span&gt;
  config.vm.synced_folder &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"./"&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"/vagrant_data"&lt;/span&gt;

  config.vm.provider &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"virtualbox"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;do&lt;/span&gt; |vb|
    vb.customize &lt;span class="o"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"setextradata"&lt;/span&gt;, :id, &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"VBoxInternal2/SharedFoldersEnableSymlinksCreate/v-root"&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"1"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
    vb.memory &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"5192"&lt;/span&gt;
  end

  &lt;span class="c"&gt;# IMPORTANT: Vagrant run this shell script setup.sh during the configuration.&lt;/span&gt;
  config.vm.provision:shell, path: &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"setup.sh"&lt;/span&gt;
end

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel"&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action"&gt;
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Create a new file &lt;strong&gt;setup.sh&lt;/strong&gt; and update the following content&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c"&gt;#!/bin/bash&lt;/span&gt;

install_mojolicious&lt;span class="o"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nb"&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"Installing Mojolicious"&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nb"&gt;sudo &lt;/span&gt;curl &lt;span class="nt"&gt;-L&lt;/span&gt; https://cpanmin.us | perl - &lt;span class="nt"&gt;-M&lt;/span&gt; https://cpan.metacpan.org &lt;span class="nt"&gt;-n&lt;/span&gt; Mojolicious
&lt;span class="o"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

install_mysql&lt;span class="o"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nb"&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"Installing MariaDB on vagrant machine"&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nb"&gt;sudo &lt;/span&gt;apt update
  &lt;span class="nb"&gt;sudo &lt;/span&gt;apt &lt;span class="nb"&gt;install &lt;/span&gt;mariadb-server &lt;span class="nt"&gt;-y&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

install_perl_module&lt;span class="o"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nb"&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"Installing the Perl Module"&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nb"&gt;sudo &lt;/span&gt;cpan &lt;span class="nb"&gt;install &lt;/span&gt;DateTime &lt;span class="nt"&gt;-y&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nb"&gt;sudo &lt;/span&gt;cpan &lt;span class="nb"&gt;install &lt;/span&gt;DBIx::Class &lt;span class="nt"&gt;-y&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nb"&gt;sudo &lt;/span&gt;cpan &lt;span class="nb"&gt;install &lt;/span&gt;Crypt::PBKDF2 &lt;span class="nt"&gt;-y&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nb"&gt;sudo &lt;/span&gt;cpan &lt;span class="nb"&gt;install &lt;/span&gt;Mouse &lt;span class="nt"&gt;-y&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nb"&gt;sudo &lt;/span&gt;cpan &lt;span class="nb"&gt;install &lt;/span&gt;Email::Valid &lt;span class="nt"&gt;-y&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nb"&gt;sudo &lt;/span&gt;cpan &lt;span class="nb"&gt;install &lt;/span&gt;Mojolicious::Plugin::Authentication &lt;span class="nt"&gt;-y&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nb"&gt;sudo &lt;/span&gt;cpan &lt;span class="nb"&gt;install &lt;/span&gt;Mojolicious::Plugin::StaticCache &lt;span class="nt"&gt;-y&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

setup_mojolicious&lt;span class="o"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c"&gt;# Setting up the Mojolicious APP&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nb"&gt;cd&lt;/span&gt; /vagrant_data
    mojo generate app vagrant_mojo
&lt;span class="o"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

main&lt;span class="o"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  install_mojolicious
  install_mysql
  install_perl_module
  setup_mojolicious
&lt;span class="o"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
main
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel"&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action"&gt;
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Save and exit the file. And run the following command.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;vagrant up
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel"&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action"&gt;
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This will take a little time to finish it up.  Once the installation is done.  Mojo app is already created under the "/vagrant_data".&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;vagrant ssh
&lt;span class="nb"&gt;cd&lt;/span&gt; /vagrant_data/vagrant_mojo
morbo script/vagrant_mojo
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel"&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action"&gt;
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It will start the webserver at &lt;a href="http://127.0.0.1:3000"&gt;http://127.0.0.1:3000&lt;/a&gt;. Go to you browser of the operating system and type &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://localhost:3000"&gt;http://localhost:3000&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, you can do any changes from your main OS under the synced directory. It will change the app by default in ubuntu OS (VirtualBox). It also preserves the environment from regular OS updates. &lt;/p&gt;

        <![CDATA[<p>These are some answers to the Week 98 of the <a href="https://perlweeklychallenge.org/blog/perl-weekly-challenge-098/">Perl Weekly Challenge</a> organized by <a href="http://blogs.perl.org/users/mohammad_s_anwar/">Mohammad S. Anwar</a>.</p>

<h2>Task 1: Read N-characters</h2>

<p><em>You are given file <code>$FILE</code>.</em></p>

<p><em>Create subroutine <code>readN($FILE, $number)</code> that returns the first n-characters and moves the pointer to the (n+1)th character.</em></p>

<p><em>Example:</em></p>

<pre><code>Input: Suppose the file (input.txt) contains "1234567890"
Output:
    print readN("input.txt", 4); # returns "1234"
    print readN("input.txt", 4); # returns "5678"
    print readN("input.txt", 4); # returns "90"
</code></pre>

<h3>Read N-characters in Raku</h3>

<p>This is my first attempt:</p>

<pre><code>use v6;

my $input = @*ARGS[0] // "I_have_a_dream.txt";

given $input.IO.open {
    for 0..2 -&gt; $num {
        my $n = (1..10).pick;
        say "Taking $n characters: ", .readchars: $n;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Using Martin Luther King's 1963 famous "I have a dream" speech at the Lincoln Memorial in Washington as an input file, I obtain the following output:</p>

<pre><code>$ raku read_n_chars.raku
Taking 3 characters: I a
Taking 3 characters: m h
Taking 4 characters: appy

$ raku read_n_chars.raku
Taking 3 characters: I a
Taking 5 characters: m hap
Taking 9 characters: py to joi
</code></pre>

<p>However, my understanding of the challenge is that, maybe, Mohammad S. Anwar wanted us to implement an iterator, rather than using a Raku built-in subroutines implementing such iterators.</p>

<p>To do that, I wrote a <code>create-iter</code> subroutine iterating over the file contents:</p>

<pre><code>use v6;

my $input = @*ARGS[0] // "I_have_a_dream.txt";

sub create-iter ($file-in) {
    my $counter = 0;
    my $content = $file-in.IO.slurp;
    return sub (Int $length) {
        my $out = substr $content, $counter, $length;
        $counter += $length;
        return $out;
    }
}
my &amp;iterator = create-iter $input;       
for 0..2 -&gt; $num {
    my $n = (1..10).pick;
    say "Taking $n characters: ", &amp;iterator($n);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Example output:</p>

<pre><code>$ raku read_n_chars2.raku
Taking 8 characters: I am hap
Taking 6 characters: py to
Taking 9 characters: join with
</code></pre>

<h3>Read N-characters in Perl</h3>

<p>This is a Perl implementation of the first Raku program above:</p>

<pre><code>use strict;
use warnings;
use feature qw/say/;

my $input = shift // "I_have_a_dream.txt";
open my $IN, "&lt;", $input or die "Cannot open $input $!";
for my $n (4..7) {
    say "Taking $n characters: ", map getc $IN, 1..$n;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Example output:</p>

<pre><code>$ perl read_n_chars1.pl
Taking 4 characters: I am
Taking 5 characters:  happ
Taking 6 characters: y to j
Taking 7 characters: oin wit
</code></pre>

<p>And here is a solution implementing an iterator:</p>

<pre><code>use strict;
use warnings;
use feature qw/say/;

sub create_iter {
    my $input = shift;
    my $counter = 0;
    open my $IN, '&lt;', $input or die "Couldn't open $input $!";
    local $/ = undef;   # enabling "slurping mode"
    my $content = &lt;$IN&gt;; # slurping the file
    return sub {
        my $length = shift;
        my $out = substr $content, $counter, $length;
        $counter += $length;
        return $out;
    }
}
my $in = shift // "I_have_a_dream.txt";
my $iterator = create_iter $in;       
for my $n (3..5) {
    say "Taking $n characters: ", $iterator-&gt;($n);
}
</code></pre>

<h2>Task 21: Search Insert Position</h2>

<p><em>You are given a sorted array of distinct integers <code>@N</code> and a target <code>$N</code>.</em></p>

<p><em>Write a script to return the index of the given target if found otherwise place the target in the sorted array and return the index.</em></p>

<p><em>Example 1:</em></p>

<pre><code>Input: @N = (1, 2, 3, 4) and $N = 3
Output: 2 since the target 3 is in the array at the index 2.
</code></pre>

<p><em>Example 2:</em></p>

<pre><code>Input: @N = (1, 3, 5, 7) and $N = 6
Output: 3 since the target 6 is missing and should be placed at the index 3.
</code></pre>

<p><em>Example 3:</em></p>

<pre><code>Input: @N = (12, 14, 16, 18) and $N = 10
Output: 0 since the target 10 is missing and should be placed at the index 0.
</code></pre>

<p><em>Example 4:</em></p>

<pre><code>Input: @N = (11, 13, 15, 17) and $N = 19
Output: 4 since the target 19 is missing and should be placed at the index 4.
</code></pre>

<h3>Search Insert Position in Raku</h3>

<p>This is a simple implementation in Raku:</p>

<pre><code>use v6;

my @tests = [3,  &lt; 1  2  3  4&gt;],
            [6,  &lt; 1  3  5  7&gt;],
            [10, &lt;12 14 16 18&gt;],
            [19, &lt;11 13 15 17&gt;];
for @tests -&gt; $test {
    say $test.gist.fmt("%-20s:\t"), find_insert-pos ($test);
}
sub find_insert-pos ($test) {
    my $target = $test[0];
    my @array = |$test[1];
    for 0..@array.end -&gt; $i {
        return $i if @array[$i] &gt;= $target;
    }
    return @array.end + 1;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Output:</p>

<pre><code>$ raku search_insert_pos.raku
[3 (1 2 3 4)]       :   2
[6 (1 3 5 7)]       :   3
[10 (12 14 16 18)]  :   0
[19 (11 13 15 17)]  :   4
</code></pre>

<p>This implementation is somewhat inefficient when the input data is large. I made a better binary search implementation, but I am so late that I can't really present it.</p>

<h3>Search Insert Position in Perl</h3>

<p><em>Update:</em> I was so late when I originally posted this that I did not have time to include the Perl program for this task. Here it is:</p>

<pre><code>use strict;
use warnings;
use feature "say";

my @tests = ( [3,  qw &lt; 1  2  3  4&gt;],
              [6,  qw &lt; 1  3  5  7&gt;],
              [10, qw &lt;12 14 16 18&gt;],
              [19, qw &lt;11 13 15 17&gt;],
            );
for my $test (@tests) {
    say "$test-&gt;[0], @{$test}[1..@{$test}-1]: ", find_insert_pos ($test);
}
sub find_insert_pos {
    my ($target, @array) = @{$_[0]};
    for my $i (0..$#array) {
        return $i if $array[$i] &gt;= $target;
    }
    return $#array + 1;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Output:</p>

<pre><code>$ perl  search_insert_pos.pl
3, 1 2 3 4: 2
6, 1 3 5 7: 3
10, 12 14 16 18: 0
19, 11 13 15 17: 4
</code></pre>

<h3>Search Insert Position in Python</h3>

<p>This is a port to Python of the Raku and Perl programs above:</p>

<pre><code>def find_insert_pos(target, list):
    for i in range(len(list)):
        if list[i] &gt;= target:
            return i 
    return len(list)

in_list = [1, 3, 5, 7]
for j in range (8):
    print('Target: ', j, '-&gt;', find_insert_pos(j, in_list))
</code></pre>

<p>Output:</p>

<pre><code>$ python3 search_insert_pos.py
Target:  0 -&gt; 0
Target:  1 -&gt; 0
Target:  2 -&gt; 1
Target:  3 -&gt; 1
Target:  4 -&gt; 2
Target:  5 -&gt; 2
Target:  6 -&gt; 3
Target:  7 -&gt; 3
</code></pre>

You are given string <tt>$S</tt> containing alphabets <tt>A</tt>..<tt>Z</tt> only and a number <tt>$N</tt>. Write a script to encrypt the given string <tt>$S</tt> using Caesar Cipher with left shift of size <tt>$N</tt>.

<h4>Solution</h4>
<pre><code>
sub caesar {
  return $_[0] =~ s{([A-Z])}{chr 65+(-65-$_[1]+ord$1)%26}regex;
}
</code></pre>

<p>This is a simple one liner - but has some neat features - other than using "regex" for the switches, although most are important...</p>

<ul>
	<li>r - return value rather than substitute in original string</li>
	<li>e - evaluate replace rather than use string</li>
	<li>g - repeat over all characters</li>
	<li>x - not needed (comments in match) - but looks good!</li>
</ul>

<p>In the <tt>eval</tt>ed replacement code - there is some clever ordering of values to reduce the need for brackets...</p>

<ul>
  <li><tt>65</tt> is at the front of the <tt>chr</tt> block as needing the bracket for the <tt>%26</tt> - it would be evaluated as the bracket wrapping the parameters for <tt>chr</tt> .. so would evaluate as:
<ul>
  <li><tt><strong>( chr(-65-$_[1]+ord$1) )</strong> %26+65</tt></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><tt>-65</tt> is at the start of the bracket - to allow us to not use brackets for the <tt>ord</tt> - if it was at the beginning you would need ord as it would evaluate ord <tt>$1 - 65 - $_[1]</tt>  as
<ul><li><tt>ord( <strong>$1 - 65 - $_[1]</strong> )</tt></li></ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Binary Substrings</h3>
<p>You are given a binary string <tt>$B</tt> and an integer <tt>$S</tt>.</p>
<p>Write a script to split the binary string <tt>$B</tt> of size <tt>$S</tt> and then find the minimum number of flips required to make it all the same.</p>

<h4>Solution</h4>

<p>As the first problem was a good one for applying "<em><strong>Golfing</strong></em>" techniques to it - I thought I would play along and try the second one....</p>

<pre><code>
sub min_flips {
  return [
    local $/ = length($_[0]),
    local $\ = $/ / $_[1],
    map { $/ = $_ < $/ ? $_ : $/     }
    map { ( $_[0] ^ $_ ) =~ y/\1/\1/ }
    map { $_ x $\                    }
    map { substr $_[0], $_ * $_[1], $_[1] }
    0 .. $\ - 1
  ]->[ -1 ];
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Notes</strong></p>

<p>
  This was designed to serve as an example of perl idioms that other programmers may find difficult to understand - and so I tried to put as many of them in a relatively short function.... a discussion thread on the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/perlprogrammers">Perl programmers</a> facebook group.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>One statement functions are a "lovely" perl concept - even if they can get a bit difficult to read....</li>
  <li>In perl there are special variables which give you information about the current process, or allow us to alter the functionality. To avoid creating variables I use these in the function. If you change these you can change how the code works - but here we use "local" copies - so that when we return from the function (block) they revert to their normal values - so we don't introduce any side-effects of our code
<ul>
  <li><tt>$/</tt> - normally the input record separator - we will use for the minimum value</li>
  <li><tt>$\</tt> - normally the output record separator - we will use for the number of chunks</li>
</ul>
  </li>
  <li><tt>@_</tt> - the list of parameters passed to a function - in this case <tt>$_[0]</tt> is the string and <tt>$_[1]</tt> is the block size</li>
  <li>Chained maps - we can simplify the maps by chaining them together, here we break it down into 5 separate stages - remember we have to read the code backwards. So we will look at the separate blocks of code working upwards...<ul>
  <li><tt>0..$\-1</tt> - this returns a list of indices for the substrings</tt>
  <li><tt>map { $_*$_[1] }</tt> - this converts those indices into start locations (<tt>$_</tt> is the value of the element of variable that the <tt>map</tt> function is processing</li>
  <li><tt>map { substr$_[0],$_,$_[1] }</tt> - this grabs the substring for the <em>n</em>th block - but keeps the start location as we will need it later...</li>
  <li><tt>map { $_ x $\ }</tt> - this maps the string we just have to have the same length as our original string - by performing a perl "string multiplication" <tt>x</tt> </li>
  <li><tt>map { ( $_[0] ^ $_ ) =~ y/\1/\1/ }</tt> - count the flips. Two perlisms here - we can use xor operator <tt>^</tt> on strings to xor the binary values of each character. <tt>y/../../</tt> - the translate operator returns the number of substitutions it makes - in this case we are substituting the ASCII character with decimal value of "1"... when the strings are same the byte value of the xor is 0 or "\0" and when they are different the value is 1 or "\1"</li>
  <li><tt>map { $/ = $_ < $/ ? $_ : $/  }</tt> - finally we keep the running total of the minimum value - We initialize <tt>$/</tt> to the length of the string (as the value must be less than or equal to that)  we could have used the <tt>List::Util</tt> function <tt>min</tt> - but I try and avoid using external modules if I can...</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>The list is the running minimums so we have to get the last element off the list - we do this with by wrapping the list in <tt>[ ]</tt> to make it an arrayref and then taking its last value <tt>[{list}]->[-1]</tt> perl indexes the last element as <tt>-1</tt>.</li>
  <li>And we return this value (implicit return)</li>
  <li>As the statement ends before the closing curly brace we don't need a semicolon {we aren't really sticking to PBP here anyway...!}</li>
</ul>

<p>Just for the golf connoisseurs amongst you - here is the solution written as a single line {each line is 60 characters long}<br />
<pre><code>sub mf_3{[local$/=length$_[0],local$\=$//$_[1],map{$/=$_<$/?<br />
$_:$/}map{($_[0]^$_)=~y/\1/\1/}map{$_ x$\}map{substr$_[0],$_<br />
,$_[1]}map{$_*$_[1]}0..$\-1]->[-1]}<br />
</code></pre></p>

<p>In fact we can shorten it further by combining some of the maps - but the code is not as easy to understand - as multiple steps are taken at once..., for golf aficionados - here is the code reduced (I think to a minimum unless you can prove otherwise).... each line is just 40 characters long....</p>

<pre><code>
sub mf{(($a,$b)=@_,$/=length$a,$\=$//$b,
map{$/=$_<$/?$_:$/}map{($a^substr($a,$_*
$b,$b)x$\)=~y/\1//}0..$\-1)[-1]}
</code></pre>

<p>This just as 104 symbols between the two curly braces</p>

<ul>
<li>I have introduced potential side effects by removing the "local"s from the definitions of <tt>$/</tt> & <tt>$\</tt>)</li>
<li>I copy <tt>@_</tt> into the special variables (<tt>$a</tt> & <tt>$b</tt>) which don't need "<tt>my</tt>"ing even under use strict - they are used in sort comparisons.</li>
<li>The <tt>y/\1/\1/</tt> is just convention - you can just drop the <tt>\1</tt> in the replace to make the code shorter.</li>
</ul>

        <![CDATA[<p>Here are solutions to this weeks challenges from the <a href="https://perlweeklychallenge.org/">Perl Weekly Challenge</a>.</p>

<p>You can find my full code on
<a href="https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/tree/master/challenge-099/james-smith/perl">Github</a></p>

<h3>Challenge 1</h3>
You are given a string $S and a pattern $P.

<p>Write a script to check if given pattern validate the entire string. Print 1 if pass otherwise 0.</p>

<p>The patterns can also have the following characters:</p>

<ul><li>? - Match any single character.</li>
<li>* - Match any sequence of characters.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Example 1:</h4>

<pre>
Input:  $S = "abcde" $P = "a*e"
Output: 1
</pre>

<h4>Solution</h4>

<p>This challenge is relatively simple - converting "file name" wildcards into perl regular expressions. the "*" wildcard is the same as ".*" in perl, "?" is the same as "." in perl.</p>

<p>So we replace them in the regex (and remembering we are tied to the ends of the string).</p>

<pre><code>
  my $regex  = '\A' . ( $pattern =~ s{[*]}{.*}r =~ s{[.]}{?}r ).'\Z';
</code></pre>

<p>A few notes about generating the regex - First we use the <code>r</code> modifier to return the value of the regex rather than editing in place - secondly we use <code>\A</code> & <code>\Z</code> just out of habit rather than <code>^</code> & <code>$</code>.</p>

<h3>Challenge 2</h3>

<p>You are given two strings <code>$S</code> and <code>$T</code>.</p>

<p>Write a script to find out count of different unique subsequences matching <code>$T</code> without changing the position of characters.</p>

<h4>Example 1</h4>
<pre>
Input: $S = "littleit', $T = 'lit'
Output: 5

<p>    1: [lit] tleit<br />
    2: [li] t [t] leit<br />
    3: [li] ttlei [t]<br />
    4: litt [l] e [it]<br />
    5: [l] ittle [it]<br />
</pre></p>

<h4>Solution</h4>

<p>This week's second problem was harder (especially as I thought my code wasn't working as this example was wrong)....</p>

<p>I'll outline the 3 solution functions that I created - two work out the number of sequences (one with memoization), and then a third actually returns the sequences.</p>

<p>The approach to all 3 is to split the string into chunks up until the occurrence of the current first letter of <code>$T</code>.</p>

<pre><code>sub uniq_subseq {
  my( $result, $haystack, $first, $needle )
    = ( 0, $_[0], $_[1] =~ m{(.)(.*)} );
  return scalar @{[ $haystack =~ m{$first}g ]}
    if $needle eq q();
  $result += uniq_subseq( $haystack, $needle )
    while $haystack=~s{.*?$first}{};
  return $result;
}
</code></pre>

<p>A bit of a nasty initiliaser - to initialise all the variables we need<br />
<ul><br />
  <li><tt>$result</tt> - the count of matches</li><br />
  <li><tt>$haystack</tt> - the string we are searching in</li><br />
  <li><tt>$first</tt> - the first character of the needle</li><br />
  <li><tt>$needle</tt> - the rest of the needle</li><br />
</ul></p>

<p>We need to a regex to split the needle into the two parts!</p>

<p>We then split the code ( a slight optimization ) - if we have reached the end of the needle - then we just need to count the occurances of the needle left {saves some function calls}</p>

<p>We then just strip of the characters of the string (haystack) up to each occurance of our search letter - and use recursion to call the function again - but this time with the remainder of the string (and the shortened needle), and them up and that is our value to return.</p>

<p>Our second function just adds memoization, by using a cache (using state variables inside the function) to remember the results of calling <code>uniq_subseq</code> as, as the string gets longer you will end up repeating this call over and over again.</p>

<p>Note: the second line of the function is used to clear the cache for performance testing {repeatedly running the method for benchmarking will always return the cached value on subsequent calls. We have to do it with a special call of the function as we are using a state variables for the cache - and this is only accessible inside the function itself.</p>

<p>For the simple examples we don't see much gain from the cache - but if you find a more complex problem... with lots of solutions this function works much better - the example we tested showed a speed gain of around 100x.</p>

<pre><code>sub uniq_subseq_cache {
  state $cache = {};
  return $cache={} if $_[0] eq '---'; ## Clear the cache to examine speed
                                      ## Can't clear state cookie from
                                      ## outside function....

<p>  my( $result, $cache_key, $haystack, $first, $needle )<br />
    = ( 0, "$_[0]-$_[1]", $_[0], $_[1] =~ m{(.)(.*)} );</p>

<p>  return $cache->{$cache_key}<br />
    if exists $cache->{$cache_key};<br />
  return $cache->{$cache_key} = scalar @{[ $haystack =~ m{$first}g ]}<br />
    if $needle eq q();<br />
  $result += uniq_subseq_cache( $haystack, $needle )<br />
    while $haystack=~s{.*?$first}{};<br />
  return $cache->{$cache_key} = $result;<br />
}<br />
</code></pre></p>

<p>The final function returns the "annotated" string showing each solution. We use a similar stripping approach - but it adds some complexity - mainly in remembering what we have stripped off the string - while we look for the parts of the needle. See code for comments.</p>

<pre><code>sub display_uniq_subseq {
  my( $haystack, $prev, $regexp, $needle, @result ) = (
    $_[0],          ## haystack (first string)
    @_>2?$_[2]:q(), ## previous string (3rd parameter if it exists)
    $_[1] =~ m{(.)(.*)} ? ('\A(.*?)('.$1.')',$2) : (q(),q()),
    ## The regex for finding matches + the remainder of needle
    ## Slightly more complex than the previous version as we
    ## remove the "optimization" step in the other two functions
  );

<p>  ## If we have exhausted the substring we return the previous part<br />
  ## along with what is left of the haystack.<br />
  ## Note individual mapped letters are surrounded by individual<br />
  ## brackets - to collapse these down to clusters of matched<br />
  ## characters - We collapse adjacent []s by stripping "][".<br />
  ## We again use the "r" modifier to just return the result<br />
  ## of the replacement.<br />
  return ($prev =~s{\]\[}{}gr).$haystack if $regexp eq q();</p>

<p>  ## regex collects anything before the matched letter &<br />
  ## the matched letter<br />
  while( $haystack =~ s{$regexp}{} ) {<br />
    my( $pre_match, $match ) = ($1,$2);<br />
    push @result, display_uniq_subseq(<br />
      $haystack, $needle, $prev.$pre_match.'['.$match.']',<br />
    );<br />
    ## add the match onto the previous string, and<br />
    ## continue to the next match<br />
    $prev .= $pre_match.$match;<br />
  }<br />
  return @result;<br />
}<br />
</code></pre></p>

<p>and without comments:</p>

<pre><code>sub display_uniq_subseq {
  my( $haystack, $prev, $regexp, $needle, @result ) = (
    $_[0], @_>2?$_[2]:q(),
    $_[1] =~ m{(.)(.*)} ? ('\A(.*?)('.$1.')',$2) : (q(),q()) );

<p>  return ($prev =~s{\]\[}{}gr).$haystack if $regexp eq q();</p>

<p>  while( $haystack =~ s{$regexp}{} ) {<br />
    my( $pre_match, $match ) = ($1,$2);<br />
    push @result, display_uniq_subseq(<br />
      $haystack, $needle, $prev.$pre_match.'['.$match.']' );<br />
    $prev .= $pre_match.$match;<br />
  }<br />
  return @result;<br />
}<br />
</code></pre></p>]]>

    <title>Perl Weekly Challenge 098</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://www.rabbitfarm.com/cgi-bin/blosxom/2021/02/06#pwc098" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The examples used here are from the weekly challenge problem statement and demonstrate the working solution.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="part-1"&gt;Part 1&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You are given file &lt;code&gt;$FILE&lt;/code&gt;. Create subroutine &lt;code&gt;readN($FILE, $number)&lt;/code&gt; returns the first n-characters and moves the pointer to the (n+1)th character.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="solution"&gt;Solution&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="perl"&gt;
use strict;
use warnings;
sub read_maker0{
    my $n = 0;
    return sub{
        my($file, $x) = @_;
        my $chars;
        open(FILE, $file);
        unless(seek(FILE, $n, 0)){
            close(FILE);
        }
        read(FILE, $chars, $x);
        $n = $n + $x;
        return $chars;
    }
}

sub read_maker1{
    my ($file) = @_;
    my $n = 0;
    open(FILE, $file);
    return sub{
        my($x) = @_;
        my $chars;
        my $read = read(FILE, $chars, $x);
        $n = $n + $x;
        unless(seek(FILE, $n, 0)){
            close(FILE);
        }
        return $chars;
    }
}

MAIN:{
    my($FILE, $number) = ("ch-1.dat", 4);
    my($read_n, $chars);
    $read_n = read_maker0();
    $chars = $read_n-&gt;($FILE, $number);
    print "$chars\n";
    $chars = $read_n-&gt;($FILE, $number);
    print "$chars\n";
    $chars = $read_n-&gt;($FILE, $number);
    print "$chars\n";
    
    
    $read_n = read_maker1($FILE);
    $chars = $read_n-&gt;($number);
    print "$chars\n";
    $chars = $read_n-&gt;($number);
    print "$chars\n";
    $chars = $read_n-&gt;($number);
    print "$chars\n";
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3 id="sample-run"&gt;Sample Run&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="shell"&gt;
$ perl perl/ch-1.pl
1234
5678
90

1234
5678
90
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3 id="notes"&gt;Notes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I actually did this two different ways. The first follows the letter of the challenge as to the parameters of the &lt;code&gt;read_n&lt;/code&gt; function and the second differs, only passing in &lt;code&gt;$number&lt;/code&gt; and does not include the filename.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before I get into the differences it makes sense to point out how &lt;code&gt;read_maker0()&lt;/code&gt; works. What is does is create a closure over the value &lt;code&gt;$n&lt;/code&gt; which will hold the current position in the file. Think of the variable &lt;code&gt;$n&lt;/code&gt; created in &lt;code&gt;read_maker0()&lt;/code&gt; as &lt;em&gt;captured&lt;/em&gt; inside the function that is being returned. This process is called &lt;em&gt;currying&lt;/em&gt; and it’s a neat trick. I’ve used it in the past for these challenges, the first being way back in &lt;a href="https://adamcrussell.livejournal.com/948.html"&gt;Challenge 003&lt;/a&gt;! In this way &lt;code&gt;read_maker0()&lt;/code&gt; is creating the function which we are referring to by the scalar &lt;code&gt;$read_n&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After each &lt;a href="https://perldoc.perl.org/functions/read"&gt;read&lt;/a&gt; &lt;code&gt;$n&lt;/code&gt; is incremented and used to &lt;a href="https://perldoc.perl.org/functions/seek"&gt;seek&lt;/a&gt; to the next position. I should note that this is not really necessary here since the value of &lt;code&gt;$number&lt;/code&gt; is never changed. In this case the &lt;code&gt;read&lt;/code&gt; alone will advance the file position as necessary. However, by including &lt;code&gt;seek&lt;/code&gt; the solution is more general. We would be able to move around the file however we want, backwards and forwards, with &lt;code&gt;seek&lt;/code&gt; if we wanted to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we see that we can capture &lt;code&gt;$n&lt;/code&gt; and use it to store the file position between function calls. The challenge states that we are to called &lt;code&gt;read_n&lt;/code&gt; with two parameters, the filename and the number of characters to read. As you can see, we do not need to keep sending the filename with each function call. The filename can also be a part of the closure!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is the difference between &lt;code&gt;read_maker0()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;read_maker1()&lt;/code&gt;. The first returns a &lt;code&gt;read_n&lt;/code&gt; function that matches the challenge specification of taking a filename and a number of characters to read. &lt;code&gt;read_maker1()&lt;/code&gt; returns a function that only takes the number of characters to read, the function itself has a stored value for the file handle we want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One small final thing to mention: anyone unfamiliar with &lt;code&gt;read&lt;/code&gt; might notice that there is no checking to see if we attempt to read past the end of the file. That is because &lt;code&gt;read&lt;/code&gt; will read all the characters it can and if it hits the end of the file it will stop. The return value from &lt;code&gt;read&lt;/code&gt; is the number of characters successfully read. While we do not check that value in this code, if we did we would see that in this example the final read would return 2, which is clear in the output shown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="part-2"&gt;Part 2&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You are given a sorted array of distinct integers &lt;code&gt;@N&lt;/code&gt; and a target `$N``. Write a script to return the index of the given target if found otherwise place the target in the sorted array and return the index.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While somewhat convoluted sounding at first this part of Challenge 098 ended up being fairly straightforward, especially when using &lt;a href="https://perldoc.perl.org/functions/splice"&gt;splice&lt;/a&gt; to do any array insertions. Probably there are more “fun” ways to have done this but the intuitive way here has an almost comforting look to it. Reminds me of university computer lab exercises!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, the approach here is to consider the possible cases. &lt;code&gt;find_insert&lt;/code&gt; starts off by checking to see if &lt;code&gt;$n&lt;/code&gt; would belong at the very start or end of the array. If neither of those cases hold we loop over the array looking for where &lt;code&gt;$n&lt;/code&gt; might be. If found in the array we return with the index, else we insert with &lt;code&gt;splice&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The challenge never asks to see the modified array so I suppose it is possible to merely return where &lt;code&gt;$n&lt;/code&gt; belongs without actually inserting it but that didn’t seem quite as sporting.&lt;/p&gt;

   <![CDATA[
     
     <p>(note: I missed this somehow, and it should have been posted a while ago. Sorry - cromedome)</p>

<h2>Name</h2>

<p>Anthony (Tony) Cook - TonyC on irc.perl.org</p>

<h2>Synopsis</h2>

<p>Free up one of the Perl core's contributors to work non-stop on making
Perl better.</p>

<h2>Project Details</h2>

<p>This grant provides the Perl Steering Committee with a development
resource to target as they will, while still providing for more
general bug fixes and other improvements to the perl core.</p>

<h2>Deliverables</h2>

<p>I propose to follow the same model as my current Perl 5 Core
Maintenance Fund grant.</p>

<p>I intend to devote around 400 hours (about 20 hours a week) over the
next 20 weeks to work on improving the core, paid by the hour at the
same below-commercial rate as previously.  Some weeks I may be able to
more than 20 hours, if acceptable this will consume more hours and end
the grant earlier.</p>

<p>I expect to post a weekly summary on the p5p mailing list detailing
activity for the week, allowing the grant managers and active core
developers to verify that the claimed hours tally with actual
activity, and thus allow early flagging of any concerns.  This isn't
required by the fund rules, but it will help me keep on track for the
monthly reports.</p>

<p>Once per calendar month I would claim an amount equal to $50 x hours
worked. I would issue a report similar to the weekly ones, but
summarising the whole month. The report would need to be signed off by
one of the grant managers before I get paid. Note that this means I am
paid entirely in arrears.</p>

<p>Also, (the "nuclear option"), the grant managers would be allowed, at
any time, to inform the board that in their opinion the project is
failing, and that the TPF board may then, after allowing me to present
my side of things, to decide whether to terminate the project at that
point (i.e. to not pay me for any hours worked after I was first
informed that a manager had "raised the alarm").</p>

<p>As with my Perl 5 Core Maintenance Fund, I expect I'll apply to extend
this grant.</p>

<h2>Project Details</h2>

<p>I think that the work that I would do to improve Perl would mostly
fall into one of four main classes: code reviews, bug fixing, helping
other contributors, and adding features - with bug fixes the most
prominent and adding features the least.</p>

<p>I'll also accept specific direction from the Perl Steering Committee
for specific work to be done.</p>

<p>Ideally this would be done with some consultation with myself, so a
large complex task involving parts of the core I'm unfamiliar with
isn't assigned (or is assigned with reasonable expectations on time).
Of course, if too many tasks are negotiated into non-existence, the
grant can be terminated.</p>

<p>In general I'd work on:</p>

<ul>
<li>Reviews of patches submitted to github as pull requests.</li>
</ul>

<p>This will improve my core knowledge, and provide more timely feedback
to non-committers using their time to help perl.</p>

<p>Metric: number and complexity of patches applied or commented on.</p>

<ul>
<li>Fixing bugs I select from the perl github issues list.</li>
</ul>

<p>While I wouldn't necessarily be working on the the harder bugs that
Dave targets, this would help bring the total bug count down, and
reduce the noise in the issue list.</p>

<p>Metric: number and complexity of issues fixed.</p>

<ul>
<li>Fixing systemic issues in perl, such as the mis-use of I32 and U32 in the perl core.</li>
</ul>

<p>Metric: complexity of issue solved.</p>

<ul>
<li>Contributing to discussion on the perl5-porters mailing list and in #p5p on IRC.</li>
</ul>

<p>For the grant, I'm specifically not proposing to:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Be a release manager.  This doesn't prevent me volunteering to act as a release manager, but that wouldn't be counted towards this grant.</p></li>
<li><p>Act as language designer - I don't feel that I'm good at this.</p></li>
</ol>

<h2>Project Schedule</h2>

<p>I expect that I can deliver 400 hours of work in approximately 20
weeks.</p>

<p>I am available to start work on this project immediately.</p>

<h2>Bio</h2>

<p>I'm a freelance programmer living in Australia.</p>

<p>I've been irregularly contributing to perl since 2008, a committer
since 2010 and have participated with the Perl 5 Core Maintenance Fund
since 2013.</p>

<p>My contributions have varied from build system fixes, to UTF-8
handling, to portability fixes.</p>

<p>I've been programming in C for 30 years and in perl for 25.</p>

<h2>Endorsed By</h2>

<p>Karl Williamson, Sawyer X, Ricardo Signes</p>

<h2>Amount Requested</h2>

<p>$20,000 (USD)</p>

<h2>Suggestions for Grant Managers</h2>

<p>SawyerX (core team), Ricardo Signes (grants committee)</p>

     <p>TPF Board members and the community leaders meet every month and here are the minutes from the December 2020 meeting.</p>

<h1>Part 1 - Community</h1>

<h2>Attendees</h2>

<ul>
<li>Board: Dave Rolsky, Stuart Mackintosh, Ricardo Signes, Curtis Poe, Dan Wright</li>
<li>Community leaders: Todd Rinaldo, JJ Merelo, Daniel Sockwell, Jason Crome, Andrew Solomon, Mark Keating, Alex Beamish,  Nigel Hamilton</li>
<li>Admin: Nic Evans</li>
</ul>

<h2>Main session</h2>

<h3>Marketing, Mark Keating</h3>

<ul>
<li>Had conversations with Gary Beckwith. He has lots to contribute regarding surveys. Need a quick survey ref TPF name - we need people's feedback in their own words, and he helps us achieve that.</li>
<li>Supporting projects and the languages and supporting community projects are the key things people are interested in. Going to get a survey out over Christmas.</li>
<li>Stuart: we need to ensure Nigel's perspective is considered in terms of trademark and branding.</li>
<li>Need a brand that is identifiable to us and then we can move on in terms of sites that are recognised as Perl resources.</li>
<li>When we do bring new people in we need to share the right resources with them (Recognised resources)</li>
<li>Some overlap between marketing and sponsorship - would like to get a meeting with the sponsorship team to talk about working together.</li>
<li>Nige: we were trying to tackle the "Perl is dead" theme and did the Raku advent calendar</li>
</ul>

<h3>Compliance / OpenChain / SPDX, Stuart Mackintosh</h3>

<ul>
<li>Ability to determine your licence position, technical project Stuart is keen to drive forward - if we can bring this structure into Perl / CPAN, that puts perl at the front of the line of professional software languages. Keen to get people's views/thoughts. Continue conversation offline</li>
<li>Curtis: I would argue it is a good theory but my clients don't care - it's not a good thing they don't care.</li>
<li>Stuart: It's about the ability to be auditable. By bringing in SPDX it helps auditability.</li>
<li>Dave: At ActiveState we have customers who really do care about this and there is a lot of interest. I could perhaps get time to do some work on it myself because it would be beneficial for us. A lot of companies care.</li>
<li>Stuart: Oracle v Google legal news - The outcome of this will that corporates have to know where the licence is and it can be audited. Something to watch. Project I am working with is funded by Linux Foundation.</li>
</ul>

<h3>TPC Conferences, Todd Rinaldo</h3>

<ul>
<li>Houston conference being moved to June 2022, Contract to be signed and deposit to be paid. </li>
<li>Board to confirm approval</li>
<li>Todd: should TPC Board member sign this? -&gt; Discussion with Board to follow.</li>
<li>We need to communicate there will be no in person conference - planning repeat of last years. Beginning planning in next month or so (after Christmas)</li>
<li>Stuart advised Todd to look at FOSDEM</li>
<li>Stuart: we all need to look at how we can amplify messages - all get involved in sharing news - make sure information gets out.</li>
<li>Mark: needs to get to all different groups outside of our own, via LinkedIn, FaceBook, Twitter</li>
<li>Stuart: need to consider structure</li>
<li>Mark: Need a channel where we say about sharing messages - act on good faith</li>
</ul>

<h3>FOSDEM, JJ Merelo</h3>

<ul>
<li>There are 6 references to Perl dev room in Twitter - we are failing - we are missing</li>
<li>It is important to submit talks.</li>
<li>Urged people to attend FOSDEM, to submit talks</li>
<li>As it is online we have a unique opportunity for all international coders to get involved and share passion about Perl and Raku</li>
<li>Currently have just 2 submissions - both are Raku. Need to get Perl speakers.</li>
<li>Stuart: FOSDEM will be very different - there is just one week to submit a paper - you don't need to have written it - just need a title and how long you need to reserve your slot. Then have one month to record slot and send to FOSDEM to publish - live QA after then hallway track.</li>
<li>Stuart will get something together to explain what people need to so - look at existing call for papers and edit, or do a new article</li>
<li>Stuart and JJ are official Perl/Raku coordinators so get to choose the papers. We can also help people work way around FOSDEM and processes and putting together a talk.</li>
<li>We have one day - would be great to have it packed full of Perl and Raku content.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Grants, Jason Crome</h3>

<ul>
<li>Most recent grant period - November - no grant submissions</li>
<li>Stats for last three years:
<ul>
<li>2018 - $32.5k proposed, $27.5k granted (approx, same below)</li>
<li>2019 - $23.5k proposed, $13.5k granted</li>
<li>2020 - $45.5k proposed, $12k granted</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Most recently completed was Jason Mackintosh </li>
<li>This year was highest of the last three years grant requests. Summary of activity to be published on TPF Blog </li>
<li>I think $20,000 a year is a good amount, ideally $25k - if looking to increase activity.</li>
<li>May need to update Charter of Grants committee to better reflect what we do. 
<ul>
<li>Will be a focus of the grants committee for 2021</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Stuart to take amount to agree for grants to the Board.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Newcomers, Andrew Solomon</h3>

<ul>
<li>We have no place for newbies to engage with experienced coders - we are looking at what we can do. </li>
<li>I have been talking to Gary to find out who the newbies are, what they need to get support, what level they are at within Perl, what chat technology they use, etc. </li>
<li>Once a survey drafted, who needs to approve it? When can it go out?</li>
<li>Stuart: no reason it cannot be done - asked Board if needed a formal approach</li>
<li>Dave: Beyond the survey we need to think about two other things:
<ol>
<li>What sort of of commitment are we making in terms of technology - is there a financial consideration; </li>
<li>How do me manage moderation?</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Stuart to share survey with Board for feedback.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Sponsorship, Alex Beamish</h3>

<ul>
<li>Been crafting message for corporates</li>
<li>Not paid attention to personal donations - need conversation with Mark about that - an interesting angle. Been concentrating on corporations.</li>
<li>Not sure we have infrastructure to do same as Python to have a major push.</li>
<li>Want to use 2021 to really push sponsorship</li>
<li>Dave: I have a lot of experience with individual fundraising so can help the sponsorship committee</li>
<li>Andrew: happy to help through Geekuni in a similar way as Python</li>
<li>Stuart: Does Board need to consider if there should be a target for sponsorship each year.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Legal update, Nigel Hamilton</h3>

<ul>
<li>Been looking at Raku trademark guidelines</li>
<li>EU trademark application - refused late November. Not sure if we had correspondence. Digging deeper with lawyers involved and following up in next few days.</li>
<li>UK trademark is fine - and currently in application in US.</li>
<li>Brexit not an issue with trademark.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Raku update, Daniel Sockwell</h3>

<ul>
<li>Had Raku Steering Council and agreed code of conduct - needs some revisions before submitting publicly to Raku community as a whole.</li>
<li>Agreed to meet roughly monthly. Next meeting early January 2021</li>
<li>Been doing Raku Advent Calendar - JJ has really spearheaded this. Been successful looking at Wordpress stats. We did lose viewers with shift from Perl 6 to Raku advent calendar, but this year we are 30% above we were were at end of December last year.</li>
<li>Coding challenge going on - has drawn a number of people from outside of the Raku community to try out raku.</li>
<li><p>Had successful outreach. </p></li>
<li><p>Stuart: what does Raku community need from Perl Foundation?</p></li>
<li>Daniel - As of now we are continuing to benefit from support of trademark work and grants committee. I will raise it at next steering council meeting.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Perl Governance,  Rik Signes</h3>

<ul>
<li>Voting underway for last 16 days. We haven't had all votes yet. </li>
<li>As far as language track - little has happened on mailing list</li>
</ul>

<h3>Perl infrastructure, Rik Signes</h3>

<ul>
<li>Infrastructure groups starting to become more active again.</li>
<li>Looking to set up some compute for hosting things.   (That is, cloud hosting for software, like Digital Ocean, Linode, and Azure, all of whom Rik has approached.)</li>
<li>What are we going to do and what are going to back burn.</li>
<li>Need to look at rt.cpan.org - one of our members thinks they can do something.</li>
<li>Discussion around dromedary.  "dromedary" is a very powerful server used by some of the Perl 5 developers for testing and other development work.  What will it be?</li>
<li><p>Depends on what people want. We'll be following up in January.</p></li>
<li><p>Dan: we like CPAN mirror and want to keep it - is it going to be a problem</p></li>
<li>Rik: people will still be able to mirror CPAN.</li>
</ul>

<h3>End of year message from Stuart</h3>

<ul>
<li>What is most important to you? I'd like to hear what you would like to be included in that message? Suggestions?</li>
<li>Stuart to write blog and publish</li>
</ul>

<h3>2021 meeting schedule planning and publication plan</h3>

<ul>
<li>Need to schedule next 12 months.</li>
<li>All OK with the time we currently hold it.</li>
<li>Nic to do calendar and share with Board for approval before publishing - publish full schedule on Perl Foundation website.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Part 2 - Board</h1>

<h2>Attendees</h2>

<ul>
<li>Stuart Mackintosh</li>
<li>Dan Wright</li>
<li>Curtis Poe</li>
<li>Dave Rolsky</li>
<li>Makoto Nozaki</li>
<li>Rik Signes</li>
<li>Nic Evans (Admin)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Main session</h2>

<h3>Grants</h3>

<ul>
<li>Need value proposition / business case</li>
<li>Budget</li>
<li>Guidance - is there a threshold, should smaller grants be easier to get than bigger grants. Tiered approach.</li>
<li>Level of grants versus income needs to be considered.</li>
<li>Need to look at value proposition and business case - what's the ROI. Can't just say it will be a great bit of code - need to say what value it will bring, how it will be used.</li>
<li>Perhaps need more dialogue with Jason to understand better </li>
<li>Should we only look at grants that benefit the perl community or look at grants that support a general problem that needs to be solved. Non-technical people could submit applications for grants to be used to solve a problem and our community use the grant to fix it.</li>
<li>Setting budget seems to be right thing to do - Look at $25k as starting point for 2021 - we can't give them autonomy then not give them a decent sized budget (Awarded in the financial year, not necessarily paid).</li>
<li>Outside of vote we need to look at how grants are reviewed, business cases etc.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Sponsorship target</h3>

<ul>
<li>Inform Alex of sponsorship target $200k</li>
</ul>

<h3>Contracts / Authority to sign, Todd Rinaldo</h3>

<ul>
<li>Has concerns about signing contracts under TPF name as not a Board member. Concerned about legal exposure. Should a member of the Board sign conference contracts?</li>
<li>ACTION: Insurance review to ensure we are covered in the activities we carry out</li>
<li>Board happy to sign contract for Houston 2022  - need Todd to send through.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Advisory board</h3>

<ul>
<li>Mailing list  - no obligations. Need to get going with building it - Web content is published: https://www.perlfoundation.org/advisory_board.html</li>
</ul>

<h3>Procedure for purchasing infrastructure items</h3>

<ul>
<li>Rik unsure of how to purchase items/services.</li>
<li>Small items can be purchased and claim back costs. Alternatively credit card is possible</li>
</ul>

<h3>Thanks to Dan for service to the Board</h3>

    <title>Perl Weekly Challenge 097</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://www.rabbitfarm.com/cgi-bin/blosxom/2021/01/31#pwc097" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The examples used here are from the weekly challenge problem statement and demonstrate the working solution.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="part-1"&gt;Part 1&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You are given string &lt;code&gt;$S&lt;/code&gt; containing alphabets A..Z only and a number &lt;code&gt;$N&lt;/code&gt;. Write a script to encrypt the given string &lt;code&gt;$S&lt;/code&gt; using Caesar Cipher with left shift of size &lt;code&gt;$N&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="solution"&gt;Solution&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="perl"&gt;
use strict;
use warnings;
sub caesar_cypher{
    my($s, $n) = @_;
    my @cypher = map { unless(ord($_) == ord(' ')){
                           my $x = ((ord($_) - $n) &lt; ord('A')?(ord($_) - $n + 26):(ord($_) - $n)); 
                           chr($x);
                       }
                       else{
                           $_
                       }
                 } split(//, $s);
    return join("", @cypher);
}

MAIN:{
    my($S, $N);
    $S = "THE QUICK BROWN FOX JUMPS OVER THE LAZY DOG";
    $N = 3;
    print "$S\n";
    print caesar_cypher($S, $N) . "\n";
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3 id="sample-run"&gt;Sample Run&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="shell"&gt;
$ perl perl/ch-1.pl
THE QUICK BROWN FOX JUMPS OVER THE LAZY DOG
QEB NRFZH YOLTK CLU GRJMP LSBO QEB IXWV ALD
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3 id="notes"&gt;Notes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The basic approach here is pretty much the straightforward one: use the ascii values for the characters and subtract &lt;code&gt;$n&lt;/code&gt;. In Perl we use the &lt;a href="https://perldoc.perl.org/functions/ord"&gt;ord&lt;/a&gt; function to do this and the &lt;a href="https://perldoc.perl.org/functions/chr"&gt;chr&lt;/a&gt; to go in the other direction, ascii value to character. The only thing we really need to be careful of is if subtracting &lt;code&gt;$n&lt;/code&gt; takes us outside the ascii range for upper case letters, then we need to add 26 to get back in range.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Certain style instructions have been burned into my brain over the years and I find them almost impossible to deviate from. The one that applies here is &lt;em&gt;Whenever possible do not use numeric literals. They are often poorly documented and become “magic numbers”, and make code readability and future debugging unnecessarily difficult.&lt;/em&gt; So it is in that spirit that I write, for example, &lt;code&gt;ord(' ')&lt;/code&gt; instead of just &lt;code&gt;32&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="part-2"&gt;Part 2&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You are given a binary string &lt;code&gt;$B&lt;/code&gt; and an integer &lt;code&gt;$S&lt;/code&gt;. Write a script to split the binary string &lt;code&gt;$B&lt;/code&gt; of size &lt;code&gt;$S&lt;/code&gt; and then find the minimum number of flips required to make it all the same.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="solution-1"&gt;Solution&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="perl"&gt;
use strict;
use warnings;

use feature "bitwise";

sub substrings{
    my($d, $s) = @_;
    my @substrings;
    for(my $i = 0; $i &lt; length($d); $i+=$s){
        push @substrings, substr($d, $i, $s);
    }    
    return @substrings;
}

sub min_flips{
    my($d, $s) = @_;
    my @flips;
    my @substrings = substrings($d, $s);
    for my $digits (@substrings){
        my $flip_count = 0;
        map { $flip_count += unpack("%32b*", $digits ^. $_) } @substrings;
        push @flips, $flip_count;
    }
    return [sort {$a &lt;=&gt; $b} @flips]-&gt;[0];
}

MAIN:{
    my($B, $S);
    $B = "101100101";
    $S = 3;
    print min_flips($B, $S) . " flips\n";
    $B = "10110111";
    $S = 4;
    print min_flips($B, $S) . " flips\n";
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3 id="sample-run-1"&gt;Sample Run&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="shell"&gt;
$ perl perl/ch-2.pl
1 flips
2 flips
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3 id="notes-1"&gt;Notes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;substrings&lt;/code&gt; function is just a convenient wrapper around the code necessary to break the string into the right sized chunks. The assumption is that the string is evenly divisible into chunks of size &lt;code&gt;$s&lt;/code&gt;. If we were not making this assumption we would need to add some &lt;em&gt;zero padding&lt;/em&gt; for any unevenly sized substring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since &lt;code&gt;use feature "bitwise";&lt;/code&gt; is present the &lt;code&gt;^.&lt;/code&gt; is defined and the operands to &lt;code&gt;^.&lt;/code&gt; are taken to be bit strings and the result is itself a bit string.&lt;code&gt;min_flips&lt;/code&gt; does a bitwise xor operation, pairwise comparing each substring in a &lt;code&gt;map&lt;/code&gt;. Since xor is 1 only when the bits are different the result is a bit string of set bits, the ones needed to be flipped. &lt;code&gt;unpack&lt;/code&gt; is used to sum these, and the result added &lt;code&gt;$flip_count&lt;/code&gt; which is then pushed into an array. The minimum number of flips is determined by the smallest number in that array. The bitwise feature was introduced in Perl 5.22 and graduated from experimental status in Perl 5.28.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="references"&gt;References&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.asciitable.com"&gt;ASCII Table&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Trouble with Reference Counting</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://perl.com/article/the-trouble-with-reference-counting/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">

&lt;p&gt;Perl uses a simple form of garbage collection (GC) called &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reference_counting"&gt;reference counting&lt;/a&gt;. Every variable created by a Perl program has a &lt;a href="https://perldoc.perl.org/perlguts#Reference-Counts-and-Mortality"&gt;refcnt&lt;/a&gt; associated with it. If the program creates a reference to the variable, Perl increments its &lt;code&gt;refcnt&lt;/code&gt;. Whenever Perl exits a block it reclaims any variables that belong to the block scope. If any are references, their referenced values&amp;rsquo; &lt;code&gt;refcnt&lt;/code&gt; are either decremented or they&amp;rsquo;re reclaimed as well if no other references to them remain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="benefits"&gt;Benefits&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reference counting has some nice properties. As GC is deterministic, it is usually not a cause of variable program performance from run-to-run. Whenever Perl leaves a subroutine or a block, it will check for variables to reclaim. This spreads the cost of GC over program runtime, keeping Perl responsive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another benefit of timely reclamation is it minimizes memory fragmentation as variables created in the same scope tend to be reclaimed at the same time, allowing Perl to more efficiently reuse the memory (it exhibits good &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locality_of_reference#Spatial_and_temporal_locality_usage"&gt;spatial locality of reference&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Predictable and timely GC provides a useful mechanism for destructors. A popular example is that &amp;ldquo;lexical&amp;rdquo; filehandles are automatically closed when they go out scope; Perl programs do not need to call &lt;a href="https://perldoc.perl.org/functions/close"&gt;close&lt;/a&gt; on filehandles themselves, and because the filehandle is closed immediately, there is no risk of contention from a new filehandle being opened on the same file before the original is reclaimed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="how-expensive-is-reference-counting"&gt;How expensive is reference counting?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Different reference counting operations have different costs. Consider the following Perl subroutine:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"&gt;&lt;code class="language-perl" data-lang="perl"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef"&gt;sub&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color:#a6e22e"&gt;update_customer&lt;/span&gt; {
  &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef"&gt;my&lt;/span&gt; ($customer, $values) &lt;span style="color:#f92672"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; @_;
  &lt;span style="color:#f92672"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s called with two arguments; a customer object and a hashref of values. The &lt;code&gt;my&lt;/code&gt; declaration causes Perl to add the lexical variables &lt;code&gt;$customer&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;$values&lt;/code&gt; to the savestack (here it performs an optimization, adding them as one group entry instead of two). Each variable is initialized with a &lt;code&gt;refcnt&lt;/code&gt; of 1. Each argument is then assigned to its corresponding lexical variable which increments the &lt;code&gt;refcnt&lt;/code&gt; of the reference&amp;rsquo;s corresponding value. This is cheap as the Perl interpreter just increments the value&amp;rsquo;s &lt;code&gt;refcnt&lt;/code&gt; in its header struct.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the subroutine returns a scope exit occurs, and &lt;code&gt;$customer&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;$values&lt;/code&gt; must be reclaimed. Their group is popped off the savestack. Perl fetches the &lt;code&gt;refcnt&lt;/code&gt; of &lt;code&gt;$customer&lt;/code&gt;, saves it to a local variable, and tests it to see if it is greater than 1. As the &lt;code&gt;refcnt&lt;/code&gt; of &lt;code&gt;$customer&lt;/code&gt; is 1, it must be reclaimed. Here Perl performs another optimization, essentially doing &lt;code&gt;undef $customer&lt;/code&gt; leaving it ready to be reused next time the subroutine is called. As &lt;code&gt;$customer&lt;/code&gt; is a reference, the referenced customer object&amp;rsquo;s &lt;code&gt;refcnt&lt;/code&gt; must also be fetched and tested. In this case it&amp;rsquo;s greater than 1, so Perl decrements the local &lt;code&gt;refcnt&lt;/code&gt; and stores it back in the customer object&amp;rsquo;s header struct. Perl then performs the same decrement routine for &lt;code&gt;$values&lt;/code&gt;. Decrement&amp;rsquo;s multiple steps causes it to be slightly more expensive than increment, but scope management pushing and popping the savestack is relatively expensive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We don&amp;rsquo;t have any data on how long each operation takes, or estimates of how long Perl spends on reference counting activities during the course of a program. Nor is such data available for other reference counting dynamic languages like Python and PHP. Some research has shown that reference counting increases GC runtime by 30% compared to tracing&lt;sup&gt;1, 2&lt;/sup&gt;, but it&amp;rsquo;s not clear how representative that is of Perl&amp;rsquo;s optimized routines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="drawbacks"&gt;Drawbacks&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reference counting scales linearly insofar as every variable created increases the GC overhead. In programming we can usually do better than that, for example by using tricks like minimizing the number of function calls via batch processing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only objects that have a &lt;a href="https://perldoc.perl.org/perlobj#Destructors"&gt;DESTROY&lt;/a&gt; method need timely reclamation, yet Perl  treats &lt;em&gt;every&lt;/em&gt; variable like it needs it, incrementing and decrementing reference counts live. Whenever Perl exits a block it must check for and clean up any unreferenced variables.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reference counting usually spreads the cost of GC over runtime, however deterministic and timely reclamation means that the potential cost of any given scope exit is unbounded. Imagine Perl returning from a subroutine which reclaims the final reference to a &lt;em&gt;huge&lt;/em&gt; graph of data, triggering an avalanche of reclamations. Perl &lt;em&gt;has&lt;/em&gt; to clean it all up immediately; a tracing GC could choose not to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reference counts increase memory use a little as every variable has a &lt;code&gt;refcnt&lt;/code&gt; integer associated with it. Compared to tracing schemes, reference counting actually saves memory by not requiring a larger heap to avoid thrashing&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. However circular references can increase memory use a lot via memory leaks (if detected the developer can &lt;a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Scalar::Util#weaken"&gt;weaken&lt;/a&gt; the reference to fix this).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reference counts can trigger unneeded &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copy-on-write"&gt;Copy-On-Write&lt;/a&gt;. Imagine a sub-process loops through a data set it inherited from its parent: &lt;code&gt;for my $foo (@foos) { ... }&lt;/code&gt;. This temporarily increments each element&amp;rsquo;s &lt;code&gt;refcnt&lt;/code&gt;, triggering a memory copy. This isn&amp;rsquo;t quite as calamitous as it sounds as each variable&amp;rsquo;s header struct  is 16 bytes. Since a page is usually 4KB, only one copy is needed per 296 objects (assuming they&amp;rsquo;re contiguous). The copy can also be avoided by not creating the lexical reference by accessing each member directly: &lt;code&gt;for my $i (0..$#foos) { $foos[$i] ... }&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speculating a little, reference counting may increase cache misses as the frequent changes in counts displace valuable data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="opportunity"&gt;Opportunity?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At first glance it seems like Perl can save runtime by switching to a tracing GC scheme and not checking or updating reference counts, but periodically reclaiming unused variables. Observe that most variables are &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tracing_garbage_collection#Generational_GC_(ephemeral_GC)"&gt;short-lived&lt;/a&gt;; therefore the cost of tracing should scale better than linearly (as only long-lived variables are traceable).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However to avoid breaking a lot of code, Perl would still need to honor timely reclamation of objects with &lt;code&gt;DESTROY&lt;/code&gt; methods. Perhaps it could follow a hybrid model, reference counting only those objects that need it, but that would reduce the performance benefits of tracing GC, and it complexifies the interpreter adding conditional branches for reference-counted variables. As objects may gain or lose a&lt;code&gt;DESTROY&lt;/code&gt; method during runtime, the interpreter would also need to be able to add and remove variables from the reference counting scheme dynamically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A further wrinkle is that references to objects with &lt;code&gt;DESTROY&lt;/code&gt; methods must &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; be reference counted (and references to those references and so on). Imagine an array of database handles: the array itself must be reference counted so that when it is reclaimed, Perl can decrement the database handles&amp;rsquo; &lt;code&gt;refcnt&lt;/code&gt; and possibly reclaim them as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A more promising line of inquiry may be to review Perl&amp;rsquo;s reference counting code for further optimization opportunities. Common techniques for improving reference counting are well known&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; and research has shown that the aforementioned 30% runtime gap can be closed&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before starting that effort, we should collect data on how much time Perl is spending on GC. Two Perl core developers, Todd Rinaldo and Tony Cook have told me they think Perl spends very little time on GC relative to other operations like memory allocation, IO and so on. If 2% of the runtime is spent on GC, reducing it by 30% is nothing to brag about. It may be the case that for Perl at least, better opportunities lie elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to Tony Cook, Dave Mitchell and Todd Rinaldo for their insights on Perl&amp;rsquo;s GC behavior.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>&lt;p&gt;Perl Weekly Challenge 096&lt;/p&gt;</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://www.rabbitfarm.com/cgi-bin/blosxom/2021/01/24#pwc096" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The examples used here are from the weekly challenge problem statement and demonstrate the working solution.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="part-1"&gt;Part 1&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You are given a string $S. Write a script to reverse the order of words in the given string.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="solution"&gt;Solution&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="perl"&gt;
use strict;
use warnings;

sub reverse_words{
    my($words) = @_; 
    if(@{$words}){
        my $word = $words-&gt;[0];
        my $a = reverse_words([@{$words}[1 .. (@{$words} - 1)]]);
        $a-&gt;[@{$a}] = $word;
        return $a;
    }
    return [];
}

MAIN:{
    my($S, $reversed);
    $S = "The Weekly Challenge";
    $reversed = reverse_words([split(/\s+/, $S)]);
    print join(" ", @{$reversed}) . "\n";
    
    $S = "    Perl and   Raku are  part of the same family  ";
    $reversed = reverse_words([split(/\s+/, $S)]);
    print join(" ", @{$reversed}) . "\n";
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3 id="sample-run"&gt;Sample Run&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="shell"&gt;
$ perl perl/ch-1.pl
Challenge Weekly The
family same the of part are Raku and Perl 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3 id="notes"&gt;Notes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My solution is done using recursion with the self-imposed restrictions&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;do not use the &lt;a href="https://perldoc.perl.org/functions/reverse"&gt;reverse&lt;/a&gt; function.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;only access array elements in an ordinary way, without using any functions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other than being a bit over engineered it works as required!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="part-2"&gt;Part 2&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You are given two strings $S1 and $S2. Write a script to find out the minimum operations required to convert $S1 into $S2. The operations can be insert, remove or replace a character.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="solution-1"&gt;Solution&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="perl"&gt;
use strict;
use warnings;

use Memoize;
memoize("edit_distance");

sub edit_distance{
    my($s, $t) = @_;
    if(length($s) == 0){
        return length($t);
    }
    if(length($t) == 0){
        return length($s);
    }
    my($s0, $t0) = (substr($s, 0, 1), substr($t, 0, 1));
    if($s0 eq $t0){
        return edit_distance(substr($s, 1), substr($t, 1));
    }
    my @sorted_distances = sort {$a &lt;=&gt; $b} (
        edit_distance($s, substr($t, 1)),
        edit_distance(substr($s, 1), $t),
        edit_distance(substr($s, 1), substr($t, 1)),
    );
    return 1 + $sorted_distances[0];
}

MAIN:{
    my $distance;
    
    $distance = edit_distance("kitten", "sitting");
    print "$distance\n";

    $distance = edit_distance("sunday", "monday");
    print "$distance\n";
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3 id="sample-run-1"&gt;Sample Run&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="shell"&gt;
$ perl perl/ch-2.pl
3
2
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3 id="notes-1"&gt;Notes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This code is a pretty faithful Perl translation of the algorithm presented in Haskell in the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance#Computing_Levenshtein_distance"&gt;Wikipedia article&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;em&gt;Levenshtein_distance&lt;/em&gt;. Like the code for Part 1 of this weeks Challenge this is a recursive procedure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As noted in that article this algorithm is inefficient in that substrings are checked repeatedly. This code can be made more efficient by the use of &lt;em&gt;Memoization&lt;/em&gt; so that the results for each substring are saved and re-used. In the interest of improving performance &lt;code&gt;Memoize&lt;/code&gt; is used with the &lt;code&gt;edit_distance&lt;/code&gt; function. While the code is now more efficient it really doesn’t have much effect on execution time for these short test strings. However, the code is now ready to handle much more significant sized strings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="references"&gt;References&lt;/h2&gt;
