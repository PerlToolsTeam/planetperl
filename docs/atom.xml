&lt;p&gt;I decided to force myself to work with an artificial constraint as a way fo forcing a little bit more creativity in my solution. When I first looked at this problem I immediately thought “ok, first thing should be to sort the list”. Based on that first impression my self-imposed constraint was to “solve this without using a sort”!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I did can be summarized as follows: 1. Find the minimum and maximum numbers in the given list. 2. Starting with the minimum number generate test sequences by incrementing upwards towards the maximum list value. 3. As each new element of the test sequence is added test to see if it is in the original list. 4. If it is in the list, good, keep going. 5. If it is not in the list then save the test sequence generated up to that point and continue with a new test sequence. 6. Return all successful test sequences and determine the longest one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most blatant inefficiency to this approach is when lists are sparse. For example, suppose we are given &lt;code&gt;(2, 100000000, 3, 4, 5)&lt;/code&gt; then we would be iterating from &lt;code&gt;2&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;100000000&lt;/code&gt;. An approach using a sorted list would basically need only loop over the elements of the list, checking to see if the next element was 1 larger than the previous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="part-2"&gt;Part 2&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You are given matrix m x n with 0 and 1. Write a script to find the largest rectangle containing only 1. Print 0 if none found.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="notes-1"&gt;Notes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike Part 1 I did not necessarily have a self-imposed constraint other than to try and be as creative as possible. I’ll only know when I look at other submitted solutions if I was really all that relatively clever or not!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here I do the following: 1. Check the size of the given matrix 2. Test the matrix for all possible sub-matrix sizes. 3. For all found sub-matrices determine the largest one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For checking the presence of sub-matrices I &lt;a href="https://perldoc.perl.org/functions/join"&gt;join&lt;/a&gt; the rows into strings and then use &lt;a href="https://perldoc.perl.org/functions/index"&gt;index&lt;/a&gt; to see if they appear in a given row or not. To determine if a sub-matrix is the largest I compare the areas of the “rectangles”.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>GitHub Actions for semi-static web sites</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://dev.to/davorg/github-actions-for-semi-static-web-sites-597g" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>I've been using <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub pages</a> to host static web sites for a few years. I wrote <a href="https://blog.dave.org.uk/2018/08/simple-static-websites-with-github-pages.html">a brief introduction on how to do that</a> a couple of years ago.</p>

<p>However, very few pages are completely static. So I still had to host many of my web sites in places where I could execute the code that was used to run the site. But in the last couple of weeks, I've realised that there is another type of site that can be successfully hosted on GitHub pages using <a href="https://github.com/features/actions">GitHub Actions</a>. I call these "semi-static" sites. It would probably help if I explained what I mean by this term. I'll start by giving an example.</p>

<p>I've written before about my <a href="https://dev.to/davorg/your-cpan-dashboard-92">CPAN Dashboard site</a>. It's a site that allows <a href="https://metacpan.org/">CPAN</a> authors to monitor the various continuous integration services that they use to develop their code. (For those of you who haven't heard of it - CPAN is the "Comprehensive Perl Archive Network - the site where Perl programmers can find thousands of libraries that extend the Perl language).</p>

<p>This site is <em>mostly</em> static. There's a page for each author who uses the site. Those pages are mostly taken up by a big table. Each row in the table contains data about one of the author's modules. There are links to the code repo and the module's page on CPAN, the version number and release date of the most recent version of the module and a series of badges indicating the status of the module on various CI services. The list of an author's modules is generated by making a call to the <a href="https://github.com/metacpan/metacpan-api/blob/master/docs/API-docs.md">MetaCPAN API</a>.</p>

<p>The site currently has two other pages: the home page (which basically lists the authors using the site) and a page telling authors how they can add themselves to the site (which is by sending a pull request to <a href="https://github.com/davorg/dashboard">the repo that hosts the site</a>).</p>

<p>As I say, the site is mostly static. There are only a few ways that the site can change.</p>

<ul>
<li>I change the information in one of the static pages</li>
<li>I change the formatting of site</li>
<li>A new author sends a pull request to add themself to the site</li>
<li>An author who uses the site releases a new module (or gives up ownership of an existing one)</li>
<li>An author who uses the site releases a new version of module (meaning that the last-released date needs to change)</li>
</ul>

<p>There is a single program in the repo that can be used to rebuild the site in all of these circumstances.</p>

<p>If I change the site in some way (the first two items in the list), obviously I know that this change has been made and can run the regeneration program and commit the regenerated version.</p>

<p>If an author sends a pull request to add themself to the site, I can merge the site, then pull down the latest version and regenerate it to add the page for the new user. But it would be nicer if I just had to merge the pull request and the rebuild was handled automatically.</p>

<p>But I can't know when an author adds a new module or releases a new version of a module - well not without monitoring CPAN rather more closely than I have time for. It would be better if the site is automatically rebuilt periodically (say once an hour) and checked in if something has changed. And that's what I can now do - thanks to GitHub Actions.</p>

<p>GitHub actions are configured by adding a <a href="https://yaml.org/">YAML</a> file to the <code>.github/workflows</code> directory in a code repo. The YAML configures what the action does and how it is triggered. Here's the current version of the workflow file for my <a href="https://github.com/davorg/dashboard">dashboard repo</a>:</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>name: Generate web page

on:
  push:
    branches: '*'
  schedule:
    - cron: '7 */6 * * *'
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    container:
      image: perldocker/perl-tester:5.30   # https://hub.docker.com/r/perldocker/perl-tester

    steps:
    - name: Checkout
      uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: Install modules
      run: |
          cpanm --installdeps --notest .
    - name: Create pages
      run: |
        mkdir -p docs
        perl dashboard
    - name: Commit new page
      if: github.repository == 'davorg/dashboard'
      run: |
        GIT_STATUS=$(git status --porcelain)
        echo $GIT_STATUS
        git config --global user.name 'Dave Cross'
        git config --global user.email 'dave@dave.org.uk'
        git add docs/
        if [ "$GIT_STATUS" != "" ]; then git commit -m "Automated Web page generation"; fi
        if [ "$GIT_STATUS" != "" ]; then git push; fi
</code></pre>
<div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel">
<div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action">
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>I think it's pretty easy to understand, but let's go through it a section at a time.</p>

<p>We start with the <code>on:</code> key. That defines when the workflow will be triggered. In this case, we have three triggers.</p>

<ul>
<li>If there's a <code>push</code> to any branch (most usefully, this is triggered when I merge a pull request)</li>
<li>On a <code>cron</code> schedule. Here I run it hourly - at seven minutes past the hour</li>
<li>And <code>workflow_dispatch:</code> adds a button to the action's page in the repo. Pressing this button will run the action at any time.</li>
</ul>

<p>The next section (<code>jobs:</code>) defines what we do. We're using the build-in ability to run in a Docker image (here, we use on of the official Perl images - which adds a number of useful Perl tools to a standard Ubuntu image). We checkout the repo, install the dependencies using <code>cpanm</code> and then run the program (called <code>dashboard</code>) that regenerates the site. We then use a low-level (porcelain) <code>git</code> command to determine whether any of the files actually changed; and, if they did, we commit the changes and they will appear on the web site.</p>

<p>This solves all of my problems. If I change the site in some way and forget to regenerate it before committing, then the site will be regenerated automatically. When I merge a pull request from a new author, the site will be regenerated automatically. And the site will be regenerated automatically each hour, which will take care of the case when any of the authors' lists of modules have changed in any way.</p>

<p>So that's what I mean by a "semi-static" site. It's one where the pages stay the same most of the time, but there are a few, well-defined, events can change the contents of the site. As long as those events can be mapped onto the various triggers for GitHub actions, then the regeneration of the site can be handled automatically.</p>

<p>Here's another example. I run another site called <a href="http://perl.theplanetarium.org/">Planet Perl</a>. This is an old-school web feed aggregator. It knows about a number of web feeds about Perl programming and it combines their content into a single page (and another web feed). Once again, there is a small list of events that can change the site:</p>

<ul>
<li>I change the look and feel of the site</li>
<li>I add a new web feed (or someone submits a pull request that adds a web feed)</li>
<li>Every hour we poll all of the feeds and rebuild the site</li>
</ul>

<p>I won't go through the workflow definition again, but <a href="https://github.com/davorg/planetperl/blob/master/.github/workflows/buildsite.yml">here it is</a> if you'd like to take a look (it's actually very similar to the previous one).</p>

<p>Please let me know in the comments if you can think of any other kinds of site that this approach would work for. Or if you can suggest any improvements to my system.</p>

<p>The original version of the CPAN Dashboard workflow was sent to me by <a href="https://dev.to/szabgab">Gabor Szabo</a>. Many thanks to him for showing me how to do it.</p>

  &lt;a href="https://perlweeklychallenge.org/blog/perl-weekly-challenge-087/#TASK1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TASK #1 › Longest Consecutive Sequence&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Submitted by: Mohammad S Anwar&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You are given an unsorted array of integers @N.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Write a script to find the longest consecutive sequence. Print 0 if none sequence found.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;Example 1:

Input: @N = (100, 4, 50, 3, 2)
Output: (2, 3, 4)

Example 2:

Input: @N = (20, 30, 10, 40, 50)
Output: 0

Example 3:

Input: @N = (20, 19, 9, 11, 10)
Output: (9, 10, 11)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel"&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action"&gt;
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#perl-solution" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;Perl Solution&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#imperative-approach" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;Imperative Approach&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've done the same task with common lisp and golang, then I guess that I naturally follow the same logic I used in both language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;sort the number&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;compare between consecutive member in the list&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;concatenate the list if they are right next to each other&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if not, start a new sequence&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and I need to add handy dummy member at the tail of the list&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;here is the code.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight perl"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;use&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;strict&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;use&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;warnings&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;use&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;v5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;.26&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# note: no sanity check !!&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;my&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;@sorted&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;sort&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$b&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;@ARGV&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nb"&gt;push&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;@sorted&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$sorted&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# dummy&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;my&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;@longest_seq_list&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;span class="nb"&gt;push&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;@longest_seq_list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;@curr_seq&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nv"&gt;@curr_seq&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$curr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$prev&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$curr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$longest_size&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel"&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action"&gt;
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It is simple challenge, so I tried learn more about raku today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#raku-solution" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;Raku Solution&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#sorting" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;Sorting&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Easy!&lt;/em&gt;, and we don't need to add 'sort( $^a &amp;lt;=&amp;gt; $^b )' because @n are all already IntStr instance.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight perl"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;unit&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;sub &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;MAIN&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(*@n where {&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;@n&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;~~&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;Int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;@n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;elems&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nv"&gt;@n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;sort&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;say&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel"&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action"&gt;
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#produce" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;Produce&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;as we go through the list, we can &lt;em&gt;produce&lt;/em&gt; the trace of our data.&lt;br&gt;
the simple example of produce is that maximum value at each step.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight perl"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;my&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;@n&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;9&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;9&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;@n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;produce&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;max&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;9&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel"&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action"&gt;
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;but I need some more information to keep at every step and decided to keep a list of numbers as we go.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight perl"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;@n&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;@n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;sort&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;map&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="vg"&gt;$_&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]})&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;([&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;])&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel"&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action"&gt;
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;and if &lt;em&gt;a&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;b&lt;/em&gt; is consecutive write down the linked numbers or start over new one.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight perl"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;@n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;sort&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;map&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="vg"&gt;$_&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]}))&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nv"&gt;produce&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="o"&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
                 &lt;span class="nv"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;first&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;tail&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
                 &lt;span class="p"&gt;??&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;append&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;first&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;clone&lt;/span&gt;
                 &lt;span class="o"&gt;!!&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;clone&lt;/span&gt;
           &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;say&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel"&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action"&gt;
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;and result looks like:&lt;br&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight perl"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;([&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;6&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;])&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel"&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action"&gt;
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now classify the number by length and grep the element has maximum size and say!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight perl"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nv"&gt;classify&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;elems&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nv"&gt;max&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nv"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nb"&gt;map&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;say&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel"&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action"&gt;
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#final-code" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;Final Code&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight perl"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;unit&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;sub &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;MAIN&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(*@n where {&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;@n&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;~~&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;Int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;@n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;elems&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Happy Coding!!&lt;br&gt;
I spent too much time on common-lisp and golang.&lt;br&gt;
I'm so sorry to say that I'll skip blog about task #2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;May Perl and Raku be with you!!&lt;br&gt;

<div>After the long-haul Sudoku Task, this week we come to meet two tiny tasks.</div><div><br /></div>

<h4>Task 1 Longest Consecutive Sequence</h4>

<div>It seems unavoidable for me that we have to sort the input first:</div><div><br /></div>

<div><tt>
<b>sub&nbsp;</b><font color="#007f00">long_consec</font>{<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>my</b>&nbsp;<font color="#0000ff">@list</font>&nbsp;=&nbsp;<font color="#007f00">sort</font>&nbsp;{<font color="#0000ff">$a</font>&lt;=&gt;<font color="#0000ff">$b</font>}&nbsp;<font color="#0000ff">@_</font>;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="#7f7f7f"><i>#...</i></font><font color="#7f7f7f"><i><br />
</i></font></tt></div><div><br />


</div><div>Then I use a <tt>for</tt> loop and a temporary list variable <tt>@potential_max_opp</tt></div><div><tt><br /></tt></div>
<div><tt>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>my</b>&nbsp;<font color="#0000ff">$max_len</font>&nbsp;=&nbsp;<font color="#00007f">1</font>;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>my</b>&nbsp;<font color="#0000ff">@max_opp</font>;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>my</b>&nbsp;<font color="#0000ff">@potential_max_opp</font>&nbsp;=&nbsp;(<font color="#0000ff">$list</font>[0]);<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>for</b>&nbsp;(<font color="#00007f">1.</font>.<font color="#0000ff">$#list</font>)&nbsp;{&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>if</b>&nbsp;(<font color="#0000ff">$list</font>[<font color="#0000ff"><b>$_</b></font>-<font color="#00007f">1</font>]&nbsp;==&nbsp;<font color="#0000ff">$list</font>[<font color="#0000ff"><b>$_</b></font>]<font color="#00007f">-1</font>)&nbsp;{<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="#007f00">push</font>&nbsp;<font color="#0000ff">@potential_max_opp</font>,&nbsp;<font color="#0000ff">$list</font>[<font color="#0000ff"><b>$_</b></font>];<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}&nbsp;<b>else</b><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>if</b>&nbsp;(<font color="#007f00">scalar</font>&nbsp;<font color="#0000ff">@potential_max_opp</font>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;<font color="#0000ff">$max_len</font>)&nbsp;{<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="#0000ff">$max_len</font>&nbsp;=&nbsp;<font color="#007f00">scalar</font>&nbsp;<font color="#0000ff">@potential_max_opp</font>;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="#0000ff">@max_opp</font>&nbsp;=&nbsp;<font color="#0000ff">@potential_max_opp</font>;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="#0000ff">@potential_max_opp</font>&nbsp;=&nbsp;(<font color="#0000ff">$list</font>[<font color="#0000ff"><b>$_</b></font>]);<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>return</b>&nbsp;\<font color="#0000ff">@max_opp</font>;<br />
}<br />
</tt></div>

<div><br /></div><div>Pretty straight-forward.</div>

<div><br /></div><div>Some ideas: There should be some more efficient algorithms, maybe similar to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counting_sort">counting sort</a> , if the range of integers is given and the integers are "dense" enough.</div>

<div>---</div>
<div>Since this is a task on list, I write Lisp codes after a few weeks&nbsp; (<u>checking: last time is Challenge #80, oh!</u> )
and it is probably a bad implementation as a lot of global variables 
have been used... Stop confession. The most interesting point is making <tt>(50 48 301 4 51 3 2 49 29 300)</tt> as <tt>((2 3 4) (29) (48 49 50 51) (300 301))</tt>
 -- from an unsorted list to a list of sorted lists which each are 
composed of consecutive integers --. Interested readers may go to GitHub
 to see the full code.</div><div><br /></div>

<h4>Task 2 Largest Rectangle</h4>

<div>I think my codes are not the most optimized.</div><div><br /></div>

<div>There is a four-layer <tt>for</tt> loops. In order to get the largest rectangle as early as we can, I put <tt>reverse</tt> for the latter two layers <tt>for</tt> loop. <br /></div><div><br /></div>

<div><tt>
<b>for</b>&nbsp;<b>my</b>&nbsp;<font color="#0000ff">$i</font>&nbsp;(0..<font color="#0000ff">$N</font>-<font color="#00007f">2</font>)&nbsp;{<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>for</b>&nbsp;<b>my</b>&nbsp;<font color="#0000ff">$j</font>&nbsp;(0..<font color="#0000ff">$M</font>-<font color="#00007f">2</font>)&nbsp;{<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>for</b>&nbsp;<b>my</b>&nbsp;<font color="#0000ff">$k</font>&nbsp;(<font color="#007f00">reverse</font>&nbsp;<font color="#0000ff">$i</font>+<font color="#00007f">1.</font>.<font color="#0000ff">$N</font>-<font color="#00007f">1</font>)&nbsp;{<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>if</b>&nbsp;(all_ones(\<font color="#0000ff">@mat</font>,<font color="#0000ff">$i</font>,<font color="#0000ff">$k</font>,<font color="#0000ff">$j</font>))&nbsp;{<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>for</b>&nbsp;<b>my</b>&nbsp;<font color="#0000ff">$l</font>&nbsp;(<font color="#007f00">reverse</font>&nbsp;<font color="#0000ff">$j</font>+<font color="#00007f">1.</font>.<font color="#0000ff">$M</font>-<font color="#00007f">1</font>)&nbsp;{&nbsp;<font color="#7f7f7f"><i>#&nbsp;to&nbsp;be&nbsp;continued...</i></font><font color="#7f7f7f"><i><br />
</i></font><br />
</tt></div>

<div><tt>all_ones(\@mat, $p1, $p2, $p3)</tt> checks the <tt>$p1</tt>-th to <tt>$p2</tt>-th column terms on the <tt>$p3</tt>-th row.</div>

<div><br /></div><div>As said, I want to get the largest rectangle as soon as possible. There is a <tt>if </tt>conditional for checking whether the rectangle with vertices <tt>($i,$j)</tt>, <tt>($k,$j)</tt>, <tt>($i,$l)</tt> and <tt>($k,$l)</tt> is larger than the currently found rectangle with largest area, before checking every entry "inside" the "rectangle" is 1: <br /></div><div><br /></div>

<div><tt>
<b>if</b>&nbsp;((<font color="#0000ff">$k</font>-<font color="#0000ff">$i</font>+<font color="#00007f">1</font>)*(<font color="#0000ff">$l</font>-<font color="#0000ff">$j</font>+<font color="#00007f">1</font>)&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;<font color="#0000ff">$largest_area</font>)&nbsp;{&nbsp;<font color="#7f7f7f"><i>#...</i></font><font color="#7f7f7f"><i><br />
</i></font></tt></div><div><br />

</div><div>Then here is the main dish of the task:
</div><div><tt>
<b><br /></b></tt></div><div><tt><b>my</b>&nbsp;<font color="#0000ff">$count</font>&nbsp;=&nbsp;<font color="#0000ff">$l</font>;<br />
<b>my</b>&nbsp;<font color="#0000ff">$bool</font>;<br />
<b>do</b>&nbsp;{<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="#0000ff">$bool</font>&nbsp;=&nbsp;all_ones(\<font color="#0000ff">@mat</font>,&nbsp;<font color="#0000ff">$i</font>,&nbsp;<font color="#0000ff">$k</font>,&nbsp;<font color="#0000ff">$count</font>);<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="#0000ff">$count</font>&nbsp;=&nbsp;<font color="#0000ff">$count</font>-<font color="#00007f">1</font>;<br />
}&nbsp;<b>while</b>&nbsp;(<font color="#0000ff">$count</font>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;<font color="#0000ff">$j</font>&nbsp;&amp;&amp;&nbsp;<font color="#0000ff">$bool</font>);<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="#0000ff">$largest_area</font>&nbsp;=&nbsp;(<font color="#0000ff">$k</font>-<font color="#0000ff">$i</font>+<font color="#00007f">1</font>)*(<font color="#0000ff">$l</font>-<font color="#0000ff">$j</font>+<font color="#00007f">1</font>);<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="#0000ff">$rect_width</font>&nbsp;=&nbsp;<font color="#0000ff">$k</font>-<font color="#0000ff">$i</font>+<font color="#00007f">1</font>;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="#0000ff">$rect_height</font>&nbsp;=&nbsp;<font color="#0000ff">$l</font>-<font color="#0000ff">$j</font>+<font color="#00007f">1</font>;<br />

<p><em>Spoiler Alert:</em> This weekly challenge deadline is due in a few days (November 22, 2020). This blog post offers some solutions to this challenge, please don’t read on if you intend to complete the challenge on your own.</p>

<h2>Task 1: Longest Consecutive Sequences</h2>

<p><em>You are given an unsorted array of integers @N.</em></p>

<p><em>Write a script to find the longest consecutive sequence. Print 0 if none sequence found.</em></p>

<p><em>Example 1:</em></p>

<pre><code>Input: @N = (100, 4, 50, 3, 2)
Output: (2, 3, 4)
</code></pre>

<p><em>Example 2:</em></p>

<pre><code>Input: @N = (20, 30, 10, 40, 50)
Output: 0
</code></pre>

<p><em>Example 3:</em></p>

<pre><code>Input: @N = (20, 19, 9, 11, 10)
Output: (9, 10, 11)
</code></pre>

<p>We&#8217;re given an unsorted array, but there is nothing preventing us from starting by sorting the array. Once the input is sorted, the solution is quite easy. Note that, if Raku or Perl did not have a built-in <code>sort</code> function, the first thing I would do is probably to implement a <code>sort</code> subroutine. I have shown elsewhere that a quick sort or merge sort subroutine can be written in about half a dozen code lines, both in Raku and in Perl, with a functional programming approach. For example, this is a quick sort implementation in Raku:</p>

<pre><code>sub quicksort (@input) {
    return @input if @input.elems &lt;= 1;
    my $pivot = @input[@input.elems div 2];
    return flat quicksort(grep {$_ &lt; $pivot}, @input), 
        (grep {$_ == $pivot}, @input), 
        quicksort(grep {$_ &gt; $pivot}, @input);
}
</code></pre>

<h3>Longest Consecutive Sequences in Raku</h3>

<p>We use three input arrays for our tests. For each test case, we simply sort the input array and scan the sorted results for consecutive sequences. Consecutive sequences are stored in the <code>@sequences</code> array of arrays and we finally display the longest sequence:</p>

<pre><code>use v6;

my @tests = [ 100, 4, 50, 3, 2 ],
            [ 20, 30, 10, 40, 50 ],
            [ 20, 19, 9, 11, 10 ];

for @tests -&gt; @t {
    my @in = sort @t;
    my $last = @in[0];
    my @sequences;
    my $index = 0;
    push @sequences[$index], $last;
    for 1..@in.end -&gt; $i {
        my $current = @in[$i];
        $index++ if $current != $last + 1;
        push @sequences[$index], $current;
        $last = $current;
    }
    my @sorted_seq = sort { $^b.elems &lt;=&gt; $^a.elems }, @sequence;
    if @sorted_seq[0] &gt; 1 {
        say @sorted_seq[0];
    } else {
        say 0;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>This displays the following output:</p>

<pre><code>[2 3 4]
0
[9 10 11]
</code></pre>

<h3>Longest Consecutive Sequences in Perl</h3>

<p>In this Perl version, we also use three input arrays for our tests. For each test case, we simply sort the input array and scan the sorted results for consecutive sequences. Consecutive sequences are stored in the <code>@sequences</code> array of arrays and we simply output the longest sequence:</p>

<pre><code>use strict;
use warnings;
use feature "say";
use Data::Dumper;

my @tests = ( [ 100, 4, 50, 3, 2 ],
              [ 20, 30, 10, 40, 50 ],
              [ 20, 19, 9, 11, 10 ]
            );

for my $t_ref (@tests) {
    my @in = sort { $a &lt;=&gt; $b } @$t_ref;
    my $last = $in[0];
    my @sequences;
    my $index = 0;
    push @{$sequences[$index]}, $last;
    for my $i (1..$#in) {
        my $current = $in[$i];
        $index++ if $current != $last + 1;
        push @{$sequences[$index]}, $current;
        $last = $current;
    }
    my @sorted_seq = sort { scalar @$b &lt;=&gt; scalar @$a } @sequences;
    if (scalar @{$sorted_seq[0]} &gt; 1) {
        say "@{$sorted_seq[0]}";
    } else {
        say 0;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>This is the output displayed by this script:</p>

<pre><code>$ perl longest-seq.pl
2 3 4
0
9 10 11
</code></pre>

<h2>Task 2: Largest Rectangle</h2>

<p><em>You are given matrix m x n with 0 and 1.</em></p>

<p><em>Write a script to find the largest rectangle containing only 1. Print 0 if none found.</em></p>

<p><em>Example 1:</em></p>

<pre><code>Input:
    [ 0 0 0 1 0 0 ]
    [ 1 1 1 0 0 0 ]
    [ 0 0 1 0 0 1 ]
    [ 1 1 1 1 1 0 ]
    [ 1 1 1 1 1 0 ]

Output:
    [ 1 1 1 1 1 ]
    [ 1 1 1 1 1 ]
</code></pre>

<p><em>Example 2:</em></p>

<pre><code>Input:
    [ 1 0 1 0 1 0 ]
    [ 0 1 0 1 0 1 ]
    [ 1 0 1 0 1 0 ]
    [ 0 1 0 1 0 1 ]

Output: 0
</code></pre>

<p><em>Example 3:</em></p>

<pre><code>Input:
    [ 0 0 0 1 1 1 ]
    [ 1 1 1 1 1 1 ]
    [ 0 0 1 0 0 1 ]
    [ 0 0 1 1 1 1 ]
    [ 0 0 1 1 1 1 ]

Output:
    [ 1 1 1 1 ]
    [ 1 1 1 1 ]
</code></pre>

<p>At first glance, this seemed to be a fairly easy task. It turned out to be much more complicated than I expected.</p>

<p>My initial idea was to scan the matrix from top left to bottom right, and, for any 1 found, to try to expand this position into a region toward the right and toward the bottom. When starting to think about the implementation, I found that this approach was going to be complicated, painful, and probably quite clumsy.</p>

<p>So, I decided to proceed in a different way: generate all rectangles toward the right and the bottom of any position with a 1, then eliminate those containing at least one zero, and find the largest remaining rectangle. In both the Raku and the Perl programs below, a rectangle consists of at least two contiguous 1s, and is uniquely defined by its top left and bottom right corners.</p>

<p>As both the Raku and the Perl programs described below are a bit complicated, I will avoid abusing the expressive power of the programming language ans will describe separately the main steps of the algorithm before providing the full program.</p>

<h3>Largest Rectangle in Raku</h3>

<p>For this program, we&#8217;ll use six matrices as test cases:</p>

<pre><code>my @matrices = 
    [ [ &lt;0 1 0 1&gt; ], [ &lt;0 0 1 0&gt; ], [ &lt;1 1 0 1&gt; ], [ &lt;1 1 0 1&gt; ] ], 
    [ [ &lt;1 1 0 1&gt; ], [ &lt;1 1 0 0&gt; ], [ &lt;0 1 1 1&gt; ], [ &lt;1 0 1 1&gt; ] ],
    [ [ &lt;0 1 0 1&gt; ], [ &lt;1 0 1 0&gt; ], [ &lt;0 1 0 0&gt; ], [ &lt;1 0 0 1&gt; ] ],

    [ [ &lt;1 1 0 1 1 1&gt; ], [ &lt;1 1 1 0 1 0&gt; ], 
        [ &lt;1 1 0 1 0 1&gt; ], [ &lt;1 1 1 0 0 1&gt; ] 
    ],

    [ [ &lt;0 0 0 1 0 0&gt; ], [ &lt;1 1 1 0 0 0&gt; ], 
      [ &lt;0 0 1 0 0 1&gt; ], [ &lt;1 1 1 1 1 0&gt; ], [ &lt;1 1 1 1 1 0&gt;],
    ],

    [ [ &lt;0 0 0 1 1 1&gt; ], [ &lt;1 1 1 1 1 1&gt; ], 
      [ &lt;0 0 1 0 0 1&gt; ], [ &lt;0 0 1 1 1 1&gt; ], 
      [ &lt;0 0 1 1 1 1&gt; ],
    ];
</code></pre>

<p>The first step will be to iterate over the six test cases and for each test matrix, to call the <code>print-matrix</code> subroutine (which pretty-prints the input matrix) and the <code>find-rect</code> subroutine, which does most of the work and will be described in greater detail below.</p>

<pre><code>for @matrices -&gt; @m {
    print-matrix @m;
    find-rect @m;
}
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>print-matrix</code> reads the input matrix line by line and prints a formated version of all such lines:</p>

<pre><code>sub print-matrix (@matrix) {
    say "[ $_ ]" for @matrix;
    say "";
}
</code></pre>

<p>For our first test matrix:</p>

<pre><code>[ [ &lt;0 1 0 1&gt; ], [ &lt;0 0 1 0&gt; ], [ &lt;1 1 0 1&gt; ], [ &lt;1 1 0 1&gt; ] ]
</code></pre>

<p>this subroutine prints this:</p>

<pre><code>[ 0 1 0 1 ]
[ 0 0 1 0 ]
[ 1 1 0 1 ]
[ 1 1 0 1 ]
</code></pre>

<p>As said before, the <code>find-rect</code> does the bulk of the work.</p>

<p>First, we make a <code>@positions</code> array of all positions (defined by their coordinates) in the matrix that contain a value equal to 1. For this, we use the <a href="https://docs.raku.org/routine/X">X</a> infix cross operator to generate a Cartesian product of all positions and filter out positions whose value in the matrix is not equal to 1:</p>

<pre><code>my $max-h = @m.end;
my $max-w = @m[0].end;
my @positions =  ((0..$max-h) X  (0..$max-w))
    .grep({@m[$_[0]][$_[1]] == 1});
</code></pre>

<p>For the first test matrix, the list of valid positions is this:</p>

<pre><code>[(0 1) (0 3) (1 2) (2 0) (2 1) (2 3) (3 0) (3 1) (3 3)]
</code></pre>

<p>The next step is to create a <code>@pairs</code> list of pairs of positions (which will represent the top left and bottom right corners of each rectangle). For this, we use the <a href="https://docs.raku.org/routine/combinations">combinations</a> built-in routine of Raku:</p>

<pre><code>    my @pairs = @positions.combinations: 2;
</code></pre>

<p>For our first test matrix, this generates a data structure like so (slightly reformatted for clarity):</p>

<pre><code>[((0 1) (0 3))  ((0 1) (1 2))  ((0 1) (2 0))  ((0 1) (2 1)) 
 ((0 1) (2 3))  ((0 1) (3 0))  ((0 1) (3 1))  ((0 1) (3 3)) 
 [content omitted for brevity]
 ((2 1) (3 1))  ((2 1) (3 3))  ((2 3) (3 0))  ((2 3) (3 1)) 
 ((2 3) (3 3))  ((3 0) (3 1))  ((3 0) (3 3))  ((3 1) (3 3))]
</code></pre>

<p>Note that, at this point, the rectangles represented by those point pairs may contain some 0s (we only know that the point pairs themselves are 1s). For example, the first point pair above:</p>

<pre><code>((0 1) (0 3))
</code></pre>

<p>corresponds to the following rectangle in the input matrix:</p>

<pre><code>1 0 1
</code></pre>

<p>As it can be seen, the bounds are 1s, but the middle item if 0. This is not a valid rectangle candidate. </p>

<p>In addition, the <code>((0 1) (3 0))</code> pair in the second line doesn&#8217;t define a valid rectangle because the second coordinate of the first pair (1) is larger than its counterpart in second pair, and we said that the first pair must represent the top left and the second pair the bottom right points of the rectangle. Here, the second point is to the left of the first. We need to eliminate these malformed rectangles.</p>

<p>The next step is therefore to keep only valid rectangles rectangles and store them into the <code>@eligible</code> array:</p>

<pre><code>my @eligible = gather {
    for @pairs -&gt; $p {
        # Remove malformed rectangles
        next if $p[0][0] &gt; $p[1][0] or $p[0][1] &gt; $p[1][1];
        # remove rectangles containing 0s.
        next if @m[$p[0][0]..$p[1][0];$p[0][1]..$p[1][1]].any == 0; 
        take $p;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Note that the following expression (using a semi-colon to separate the coordinate ranges) :
    @m[$p[0][0]..$p[1][0];$p[0][1]..$p[1][1]]</p>

<p>flattens the input rectangle into a flat list, so that we can use a simple <code>any</code> <a href="https://docs.raku.org/type/Junction">junction</a> to detect any 0 item.</p>

<p>If the <code>@eligible</code> array is empty, then we did not find any suitable rectangle. In such a case, we print 0 and exit the subroutine.</p>

<pre><code>say "0\n" and return unless @eligible;
</code></pre>

<p>In the case of our first test matrix, there are six eligible rectangles:</p>

<pre><code>[((2 0) (2 1))  ((2 0) (3 0))  ((2 0) (3 1))  
 ((2 1) (3 1))  ((2 3) (3 3))  ((3 0) (3 1))
]
</code></pre>

<p>We now need to pick the largest rectangle. For this, we simply sort in descending order according to their area size. In Raku, when the code object passed as the first parameter to the <code>sort</code> subroutine takes only one parameter, then it is not a comparison code block, but a code object implementing the transformation to be applied to all items before applying the default <code>cmp</code>comparison subroutine. Here, we use this code block:</p>

<pre><code>{($_[1][0] - $_[0][0] + 1) * ($_[1][1] - $_[0][1] + 1)}
</code></pre>

<p>in order to compute the area of the rectangle and use it for the comparison. So the sort block looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>my $rect = (reverse sort { 
        ($_[1][0] - $_[0][0] + 1) * ($_[1][1] - $_[0][1] + 1) 
        }, @eligible)[0];
</code></pre>

<p>Now, we&#8217;re done, we have the largest rectangle, we only need to display the result.</p>

<p>This is the full code of the program:</p>

<pre><code>use v6;

my @matrices = 
    [ [ &lt;0 1 0 1&gt; ], [ &lt;0 0 1 0&gt; ], [ &lt;1 1 0 1&gt; ], [ &lt;1 1 0 1&gt; ] ],

<h3>Largest Rectangle in Perl</h3>

<p>For this program, we&#8217;ll use seven matrices for our test cases:</p>

<pre><code>my @matrices = 
    ( [ [ qw &lt;0 1 0 1&gt; ], [ qw &lt;0 0 1 0&gt; ], 
        [ qw &lt;1 1 0 1&gt; ], [ qw &lt;1 1 0 1&gt; ] 
      ], 

      [ [ qw &lt;1 1 0 1&gt; ], [ qw &lt;1 1 0 0&gt; ], 
        [ qw &lt;0 1 1 1&gt; ], [ qw &lt;1 0 1 1&gt; ] 
      ],

      [ [ qw &lt;0 1 0 1&gt; ], [ qw &lt;1 0 1 0&gt; ], 
        [ qw &lt;0 1 0 0&gt; ], [ qw &lt;1 0 0 1&gt; ] 
      ],

      [ [ qw &lt;1 1 0 1 1 1&gt; ], [ qw &lt;1 1 1 0 1 0&gt; ], 
          [ qw &lt;1 1 0 1 0 1&gt; ], [ qw &lt;1 1 1 0 0 1&gt; ] 
      ],

      [ [ qw &lt;0 0 0 1 0 0&gt; ], [ qw &lt;1 1 1 0 0 0&gt; ], 
          [ qw &lt;0 0 1 0 0 1&gt; ], [ qw &lt;1 1 1 1 1 0&gt; ], 
          [ qw &lt;1 1 1 1 1 0&gt;],
      ],
      [ [ qw &lt;1 0 1 0 1 0&gt; ], [ qw &lt;0 1 0 1 0 1&gt; ], 
          [ qw &lt;1 0 1 0 1 0&gt; ], [ qw &lt;0 1 0 1 0 1&gt; ],

          [ qw &lt;0 0 1 1 1 1&gt; ],
      ],
    );
</code></pre>

<p>The first step will be to iterate over the seven test cases and for each test matrix, to call the <code>print_matrix</code> subroutine (which pretty-prints the input matrix) and the <code>find_rect</code> subroutine, which does most of the work and will be described in detail below.</p>

<pre><code>for my $m_ref (@matrices) {
    print_matrix($m_ref);
    find_rect($m_ref);
}

sub print_matrix {
    my @matrix = @{$_[0]};
    say "";
    say "[ @$_ ]" for @matrix;
    say "";
}
</code></pre>

<p>For our first sample matrix:</p>

<pre><code>             [ [ qw &lt;0 1 0 1&gt; ], [ qw &lt;0 0 1 0&gt; ], 
               [ qw &lt;1 1 0 1&gt; ], [ qw &lt;1 1 0 1&gt; ] 
             ],
</code></pre>

<p>the <code>print_matrix</code> subroutine displays this:</p>

<pre><code>[ 0 1 0 1 ]
[ 0 0 1 0 ]
[ 1 1 0 1 ]
[ 1 1 0 1 ]
</code></pre>

<p>As said before, the <code>find-rect</code> does the bulk of the work.</p>

<p>First, we make a <code>@positions</code> array of all positions (defined by their coordinates) in the matrix that contain a value equal to 1. For this, we use a nested <code>for</code> loop:</p>

<pre><code>my @positions;
for my $i (0..$#m) {
    for my $j (0..$#{$m[0]}) {
        push @positions, [$i, $j] unless $m[$i][$j] == 0;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>For the first test matrix, we obtain the following non-zero positions:</p>

<pre><code>(0 1) (0 3) (1 2) (2 0) (2 1) (2 3) (3 0) (3 1) (3 3)
</code></pre>

<p>Then we use another nested <code>for</code> loop to find all the point pairs:</p>

<pre><code>my @pairs;
for my $k (0..$#positions) {
    for my $n ($k+1..$#positions) {
        push @pairs, [ [@{$positions[$k]}], [@{$positions[$n]}] ];
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Note that, at this point, the rectangles represented by those point pairs may contain some 0s (we only know that the point pairs themselves are 1s). For example, the first point pair generated:</p>

<pre><code>((0 1) (0 3))
</code></pre>

<p>corresponds to the following rectangle in the matrix:</p>

<pre><code>1 0 1
</code></pre>

<p>As it can be seen, the bounds are 1s, but the middle item is 0. This is not a valid rectangle candidate. </p>

<p>In addition, we obtain pairs such as <code>((0 1) (3 0))</code> , which doesn&#8217;t define a valid rectangle because the second coordinate of the first pair (1) is larger than its counterpart in second pair, and we said earlier that the first pair must represent the top left point and the second pair the bottom right point of the rectangle. Here, the second point is to the left of the first. We need to eliminate these malformed rectangles.</p>

<p>The code below eliminates invalid rectangles and stores the others in the <code>@eligible</code> array:</p>

<pre><code>my @eligible;
for my $p_ref (@pairs) {
    my @p = @$p_ref;
    # Remove malformed rectangles
    next if $p[0][0] &gt; $p[1][0] or $p[0][1] &gt; $p[1][1];
    # Remove rectangles containing 0s
    my $only_ones = 1;
    for my $i ($p[0][0].. $p[1][0]) {
        for my $j ($p[0][1]..$p[1][1]) {
            if ($m[$i][$j] == 0) {
                $only_ones = 0;
                next;
            }
        }
    }
     push @eligible, $p_ref if $only_ones;
}
</code></pre>

<p>If the <code>@eligible</code> array is empty, then we did not find any suitable rectangle. So, we print out 0 and exit the subroutine.</p>

<pre><code>say "0\n" and return unless @eligible;
</code></pre>

<p>In the case of our first test matrix, there are six eligible rectangles left:</p>

<pre><code>((2 0) (2 1))  ((2 0) (3 0))  ((2 0) (3 1))  ((2 1) (3 1))  ((2 3) (3 3))  ((3 0) (3 1))
</code></pre>

<p>We now need to find the largest rectangle. For this, we sort the eligible rectangles in descending order according to their area size and pick the first one in the sorted list. Since the comparison routine computing the rectangle area is somewhat complicated, we use a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schwartzian_transform">Schwartzian Transform</a> for the sort:</p>

<pre><code>my @sorted = map { $_-&gt;[0] } 
             sort { $b-&gt;[1] &lt;=&gt; $a-&gt;[1] }
             map { [$_, ($_-&gt;[1][0] - $_-&gt;[0][0] + 1) 
                   * ($_-&gt;[1][1] - $_-&gt;[0][1] + 1)] } 
                   @eligible;
my $rect = $sorted[0];
</code></pre>

<p>Now that we have found the largest rectangle, we only need to display the result.</p>

<p>This is the full code of the program:</p>

<pre><code>use strict;

    <title>Weekly Challenge 087</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://dev.to/simongreennet/weekly-challenge-087-6mj" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://perlweeklychallenge.org/blog/perl-weekly-challenge-087/"&gt;Challenge&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#task-1-longest-consecutive-sequence" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  TASK #1 › Longest Consecutive Sequence
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#task" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Task
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You are given an unsorted array of integers &lt;code&gt;@N&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Write a script to find the longest consecutive sequence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#my-solution" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  My solution
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Print 0 if none sequence found&lt;br&gt;
This was relatively straight forward. Once I checked that we have one or more integer values, I then loop through a sorted list of numbers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have an array &lt;code&gt;@current&lt;/code&gt; that stores the current run. This gets reset if the last number is not one less than the current number. I then set &lt;code&gt;@largest&lt;/code&gt; to store the largest sequence of integers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If &lt;code&gt;@largest&lt;/code&gt; contains at least two numbers I print that array, otherwise I print zero.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On a programming note, I know that I can use &lt;code&gt;if (@a &amp;lt; @b) {&lt;/code&gt;, but I still prefer to use &lt;code&gt;if (scalar(@a) &amp;lt; scalar(@b) {&lt;/code&gt;. That way it is pretty clear want I meant, rather than Perl novices needed to know Perl will return the size of an array in a scalar context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#examples" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Examples
&lt;/h2&gt;


&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;» ./ch-1.pl 100 4 50 3 2
Output: (2, 3, 4)

» ./ch-1.pl 20 30 10 40 50
Output: 0

» ./ch-1.pl 20 19 9 11 10
Output: (9, 10, 11)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel"&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action"&gt;
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#task-2-largest-rectangle" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  TASK #2 › Largest Rectangle
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#task" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Task
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You are given matrix &lt;code&gt;m x n&lt;/code&gt; with &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Write a script to find the largest rectangle containing only 1. Print &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt; if none found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#my-solution" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  My solution
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is similar to the '&lt;a href="https://perlweeklychallenge.org/blog/perl-weekly-challenge-084/#TASK2"&gt;Find Square&lt;/a&gt;' task of challenge 084.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I probably over comment my code in PWC tasks. Mainly as it helps others follow my logic. So using nothing other the comment lines, here's how I solved this task:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;    # Process the input
    # Sanity check
    # Go through each rows and column
    # The top left of a square cannot be on the right or bottom row (hence -2)
            # No rectangle if this row has &amp;lt; 2 zeros
            # Find the maximum rectangle size
                # No more rectangles can be made from this starting point
                # Update the largest rectangle if this one is bigger
    # Display the output
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel"&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action"&gt;
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#examples" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Examples
&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;» ./ch-2.pl '[ 0 0 0 1 0 0 ]' '[ 1 1 1 0 0 0 ]' '[ 0 0 1 0 0 1 ]' '[ 1 1 1 1 1 0 ]' '[ 1 1 1 1 1 0 ]'
[ 1 1 1 1 1 ]
[ 1 1 1 1 1 ]

» ./ch-2.pl '[ 1 0 1 0 1 0 ]' '[ 0 1 0 1 0 1 ]' '[ 1 0 1 0 1 0 ]' '[ 0 1 0 1 0 1 ]'
Output: 0

» ./ch-2.pl '[ 0 0 0 1 1 1 ]' '[ 1 1 1 1 1 1 ]' '[ 0 0 1 0 0 1 ]' '[ 0 0 1 1 1 1 ]' '[ 0 0 1 1 1 1 ]'
[ 1 1 1 1 ]
[ 1 1 1 1 ]
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel"&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action"&gt;
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

     <p>TPF Board members and the community leaders meet every month and here are the minutes from the October 2020 meeting.</p>

<h2>Part 1 - Community</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Attendees</p>

<ul>
<li>Board: Stuart Mackintosh, Peter Krawczyk, Dan Wright, Dave Rolsky, Ricardo Signes, Makoto Nozaki (late) </li>
<li>Leaders: Jason Crome, Samantha McVey, Alex Beamish, Sawyer X, Todd Rinaldo, Matthias Bloch</li>
<li>Admin: Nic Evans</li>
<li>Confirmed absence: Mark Keating, Curtis Poe</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Grants</p>

<ul>
<li>One grant approved - needs funding as there's no budget</li>
<li>Another grant was approved earlier but no work started 
<ul>
<li>Should have been canceled / resubmitted already according to the charter</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Working with Nic on website updates - close to completion</li>
<li>Main issue - no working budget
<ul>
<li>Possibly review previous budgets and consider how this can be increased per year</li>
<li>Funds are sectioned to languages (GC, Perl and Raku)</li>
<li>Pete looking to rearrange fund 'pots' to enable easier tracking next year</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Discussion around grants funding for funds - Can/should there be different pots? Can sponsors request specific support for each language - this needs further discussion - Jason Crome to follow up</li>
<li>Grant suggestions from the committee are available on the web</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Marketing</p>

<ul>
<li>Brief survey carried out regarding brand of The Perl Foundation</li>
<li>Highlighted need for wider survey, putting together budget proposal</li>
<li>Filled in creative brief for TPF</li>
<li>Promotion of TPF via Google Ads - discussion going on</li>
<li>z/OS article was mentioned as a good addition to marketing</li>
<li>Website improvements, bugs/issues list created</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>The Perl/Raku Conference (USA)</p>

<ul>
<li>The contract of 2020/2021 is active</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>EU Conference</p>

<ul>
<li>Discussion points: Organizers and sponsorship</li>
<li>Organizers
<ul>
<li>Andrew mentioned possibility of Perl/Raku conference</li>
<li>Should we talking about making EU conference a TPF event?</li>
<li>There is currently no immediate visible interest in having funding of an EU conference in Europe taken over by TPF</li>
<li>Historically YEF was formed because TPF didn't have the people to do this. Also EPO was formed</li>
<li>We need to talk to the key people to organize an event in Europe</li>
<li>The nature of conferences may be different going forward, we don't know when they will return to how they used to be. We need to look at our future - do we want more virtual conferences? Are there other opportunities for physical?</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Sponsorship</p>

<ul>
<li>Costs might be lower for virtual - how easy to get sponsors for virtual versus physical conferences?</li>
<li><p>We need to be clear with sponsors if we have both a US and an EU conference</p></li>
<li><p>Opinions:</p>

<ul>
<li>We have obligations to control how money is spent. There must be set guidelines. Whenever we create a special bucket for sponsorship we have an obligation to spend money on that bucket. We cannot then spend it on something else. What if we collect funds for a conference and it doesn't happen? We would have to give the money back. Currently we ask sponsors to give money to TPF (general funds) for this reason.</li>
<li>I want to make sure when I talk to sponsors to steer away from where money is going to 'this is TPF and we have various things we want to spend money on'. We need to avoid earmarked funds . Do not encourage sponsorship for specific items such as a conference.</li>
<li>I see this as more of an opportunity to get more money especially when the conference is held in a city where a major sponsor is located - need to find a way around legal issues - otherwise a missed opportunity</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Could have a soft earmarking with disclaimer such as 'should event not happen, it will be moved to general funds.'</li>
</ul></li>
<li>To continue discussion at next meeting</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Raku</p>

<ul>
<li>The Raku steering council formed recently, elected by core developers.</li>
<li>Question: How does CAT relate to Raku community?</li>
<li>Stuart: joint decision taken to keep Raku with TPF for now - longer term vision keen to progress recognised resources. These must adhere to set of recognised quality standards. CAT was established to do this, so should also provide support to Raku communities. Although sounds like marketing, it is a governance function. So we should support Raku Steering Council in any conduct issues. We need a recognised Raku presence within the organisation. </li>
<li>Action: invite member of Raku community to attend the Community leaders meeting - let them know TPF will support Raku community</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Perl</p>

<ul>
<li>Governance work to try and over time figure out a proper governance structure that is understood, accepted and supported by the community. </li>
<li>Stuart: this is about creating a process that will help the technical ecosystem for a long time. If it takes a long time, it needs to be done right/as best it can be - follow up again next month</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Infrastructure</p>

<ul>
<li>Trying to get a coherent list of what needs to be done</li>
<li>Discussion on getting perl web infrastructure managed under same system</li>
<li>All the essential password are documented</li>
<li>We need to look at Github tracker and see that issues are closed</li>
<li>Feedback at moment is positive - need to promote the committee exists when it is in a good position.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2>Part 2 - Board</h2>

<h3>Attendees</h3>

<ul>
<li>Stuart Mackintosh, Dave Rolsky, Dan Wright, Ricardo Signes, Pete Krawczyk, Makoto Nozaki, Nic Evans (admin)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Meeting topics</h3>

<p>Note: the second part of the meeting (the board only) was short as the first part overran.</p>

<ul>
<li>TPRC 2020 Transparency Report was drafted. It will be reviewed and posted.</li>
<li>Advisory Board - action items below.
<ul>
<li>Define the charter and procedure to "retire" people from the board</li>
<li>Think whether we could invite somebody to the Advisory Board even if they are not a board member</li>
<li>Announce the Advisory Board with inaugural members</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="before" href="editor-content.html?cs=utf-8"></a>SUDOKU... before the Perl script</h3>

<div>I had written an command-line application of Sudoku as a project 
submitted for Hong Kong public exam. Looking back my codes, comparing 
with the testings this time, I have been as stubborn (for the field I am
 interested in =_=" ) as that teen in 2006. </div>

<div>When I saw the task statement, the task "N Queens" (<a href="https://perlweeklychallenge.org/blog/perl-weekly-challenge-062/">Challenge #062</a>)(<a href="https://perlweeklychallenge.org/blog/perl-weekly-challenge-063/">headlines afterwards</a>) popped in my mind! I knew the Task 2 of Challenge #086 would be a long haul, even if one tried to write a minimalist script.</div>

<div>Actually I did not have much memory about the Pascal codes. I 
remember that it can run and gave me an "A" for the subject (in public 
exam), but at that time I did not have much knowledge of good codes. I 
digged the codes out from mailbox and was comforted a bit that the codes
 had good consideration of the game. One could choose to play the 
"advanced" puzzle, which may require some "trial and error" or 
simultaneous visualization on a few cells; and the "beginner" puzzles 
could be solved by the technique "naked single" - like the example given
 in The Weekly Challenge -. As a final note for those Pascal codes, the 
consideration of the two diagonals Sudoku variant "X-Sudoku" was even 
implemented. </div>

<div>So, come back to 2020, how was I planning to treat Sudoku this 
time? I am often ambitious; thinking of the fact that the number of 
Latin alphabet equals 5*5+1, I thought of a script capable of producing 
25x25 Sudoku...</div>

<h3><a name="pascal" href="editor-content.html?cs=utf-8"></a>Pascal program written in 2006</h3>

<h4><a name="pas_start"></a>Pascal code: Data structures in the beginning</h4>

This is the beginning of one of the two source code files which is mostly for algorithmic stuff:

<pre>unit solving;

interface
type
  noset = set of 0..9;
  bdbasic = array[0..8,0..8] of byte;
  tribd = record
    puz,ans,ref :bdbasic;
  end;
  fiveg = record
    bd : array[0..5] of bdbasic;
    anpo :byte;
  end;

{two functions for user interface, one is of type fiveg, another is of type tribd; skip here}

implementation

type
  cellval = record
    val :byte;
    poss :noset;
  end;
  bdpos = record
    cel : array[0..8,0..8] of cellval;
    nxn : array[0..2,0..8] of noset;
    found :integer;
    valid :boolean;
    gametype :byte;
  end;</pre>

<div><tt>noset</tt> means "(a) set of number" here. <tt>poss</tt> stands for "possible/possibility".</div>


<h4><a name="pas_randombd" href="editor-content.html?cs=utf-8"></a>Pascal code: Generating a 9x9 Sudoku Puzzle</h4>
<pre>procedure randombd(par :byte; var given :bdbasic);
var validor,theboard :bdbasic; i,j,k :byte;okok :boolean;
begin
  repeat
    theboard := given;
    for k := 1 to par do begin
      j := random(9); i := random(9);
      if theboard[j,i] = 0 then theboard[j,i] := random(9)+1;
    end;

    okok := true;
    k := 0;

<div>Overall Comments: </div>

<div>There were a lots of typing. At that time, I worked under the Turbo Pascal IDE. And I did not make any comments on the codes - oh, bad practice - ; my teacher and the graders have been teachers, seems never been professional programmers. I would get a "B" or "C" for the confusing variable names without explanation. </div>

<div>"repeat - until" block has been used many times in these code excerpts.</div>

<div>Observant readers may find that I did not make a good use of the built-in difference of <tt>procedure</tt> and <tt>function</tt> in Pascal. </div>

<div>I cannot find the final compiled executable file. The screenshot is
 from codes in the middle stage of development (for my memorial).
 I roughly backupped the codes and .exe(s) in email account inbox.</div>

<h3><a name="perl" href="editor-content.html?cs=utf-8"></a>How I do Sudoku in 2020</h3>
<div>Here are the summary of subroutines of my SUBMITTED code: (total ~15)</div>

<pre>sub num_repr
sub internal_repr_to_trad_3
sub internal_repr_to_trad
sub TEST_print_board
sub coord_to_nth_row
sub coord_to_nth_col
sub coord_to_nth_ssq
sub checkrows  # haven't been used
sub checkcols  # haven't been used
sub r_ssq_tl
sub checkssqs  # haven't been used
sub come_bk_from_fail_attempt
sub declare_impossibility
sub check_complete
sub action_on_new_node
sub bitstr_to_set_of_alphabets
sub choose_an_empty_entry
sub choose_possible_values_for_entry
sub random_an_array
sub countz
sub main
sub initialize
</pre>

And at the beginning comments of the code, I make an apology:
<pre># Caution: The part for declaring impossibility hasn't been tested.
# Caution: The subroutine "come_bk_after_fail_attempt" 
#          is not logically complete 
</pre>

<h4>Approach</h4>
<p>It is a combination of Depth-First Tree and recursion. <tt>action_on_new_node</tt> uses DFT, and <tt>come_bk_from_fail_attempt</tt>
 uses recursion if needed. The former subroutine calls the latter 
sometimes. (Here, blogging, I realize that I should output "node id" 
instead of "tree id" to show the progression of the script.) </p>

<div>Many coders put a number into grid when the number of possible value<i>s</i>
 of the grid is 1. What if there are no such grids? <b>Many codes will CAUSALLY (e.g. by order in the position) choose a grid which hasn't filled and start "trial and error". At this point, however, I will choose one of 
those with the number of possible values being 2, or 3 if none as 2, or 4
 if none as 3, or 5 if none as 6... You get what I mean even I make 
grammatical mistakes. The existence of <tt><font color="#0000ff">$min_opp</font></tt> do the job. Without evidence, I claim this is an important

<h4><a name="large_sudoku" href="editor-content.html?cs=utf-8"></a>16x16 Sudokus and 25x25 Sudokus</h4>

After seeing THAT warning messages several times, I asked the Internet and it replied with <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20710284/why-is-perl-so-afraid-of-deep-recursion">haskell - Why is Perl so afraid of "deep recursion"? - Stack Overflow</a>.

<div>What interests me is that why I haven't met the deep recursion 
warning for generating 9x9 Sudokus. I have tested the 9x9 sudokus a few 
times through the following line:</div>

<div><tt>for my $t (1..1000) {main(); print $t,"\n";}</tt></div>

<div>Every time no error messages. Arrrrrrrrrrr. Is there due to something mathematical? Possibly it is about the possible depth of tree, but I again have no a rigorous proof yet. </div>

<div>For The Weekly Challenge, after finishing some work I think it is 
notable, or probably unique, I would look on other participants' blogs 
or codes usually. I am very impressed with Mr Abigail's description and 
ambition for this task. Like, q x p boxes for N x N sudoku, where N = p x
 q. The CPAN module (mentioned in Mr Roger Bell_West's blog) has 
impressed me also by its number of variants.</div>

<div>Many years ago, near the year I made the sudoku application for 
public exam, while Sudoku were hot around the world, I chatted with a 
Math PhD candidate on Olympiad Math Training. We both thought that Sudoku
 seems not as interesting as other math puzzles.</div>

<div>Do you think I have changed my mind? :P</div>

        <![CDATA[<p>For a long time (since 2012), <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/REST::Neo4p">REST::Neo4p</a> has provided a way for Perlers to play, and even work, with the graph database <a href="https://neo4j.com">Neo4j</a>. </p>

<p>Neo4j has made many changes and improvements in its server and its query language in that time. However, as it has become successful commercially, it has made breaking API changes of one kind or another more and more regularly. In the last major release, version 4.0, Neo4j retired the REST endpoint on which REST::Neo4p was based. This endpoint was "entity-based", as it were, allowing direct access to nodes, relationships, and the like via entity IDs. It was well suited to the object (HAR HAR) of REST::Neo4p. But Neo4j decided to focus exclusively on its declarative query language <a href="https://neo4j.com/docs/cypher-manual/current/">Cypher</a>, and to move away from the "graph walking" paradigm that the REST endpoint represented.</p>

<p>It was at this point that I hoped that REST::Neo4p could finally go on to its heavenly reward. But, alas, there were folks still using it who were bummed that it didn't work with 4.0. Thankfully, Arne Johannessen (AJNN) created <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Neo4j::Driver">Neo4::Driver</a>, that does an excellent job of realizing the latest Neo4j "language driver" conventions. It also is based on the new server's so-called "HTTP" endpoint. This endpoint should last for at least a couple of years.</p>

<p>Thanks to Neo4j::Driver, REST::Neo4p 0.4000 can be used with Neo4j 4.0+ (as well as earlier versions with the HTTP endpoint), with almost all of its object mapping features in place. Ideally, it should just work with 4.0. If it doesn't, <a href="https://github.com/majensen/rest-neo4p/issues">please create an issue</a>. </p>

<p>The Neo4j::Driver "agent" in REST::Neo4p is really an emulation, using Cypher queries, of a large fraction of the original REST API. It probably is the limit to which the ideas can pushed. From here, Neo4j::Driver is the way forward in Perl 5, based as it is on declarative queries. </p>

<p>I hope the latest version will help those few folks who have come to REST::Neo4p over the years make the transition. It should allow you to avoid replicating your working code with a ton of irritating little frigging cypher queries everywhere. Since I <a href="https://github.com/majensen/rest-neo4p/blob/master/lib/REST/Neo4p/Agent/Neo4j/DriverActions.pm">did it</a>. Yes, I do want a medal. Or maybe a fish slap.</p>

<p>By the way-- Neo4j's custom protocol over TCP - called <a href="https://7687.org/">Bolt</a> - is a key component of their architecture, and I expect that the Bolt endpoint will ultimately rule them all. Arne and I are working on that; see, e.g., <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Neo4j::Bolt">Neo4j::Bolt</a>. A topic for another time.</p>

    <content type="text">When it comes to cloud-based Perl build systems, ActiveState was one of the first to provide a non-local build experience &lt;a href="https://www.activestate.com/blog/universal-package-managers-meet-the-state-tool/?utm_source=Perl-weekly-newsletter&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_content=blog-perl without-compiler&amp;utm_campaign=user-acquisition"&gt;(PPM)&lt;/a&gt;.

    <title>#486 - Why do we use Perl?</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://perlweekly.com/archive/486.html" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Hi there</p>
<p>I have been asked this question many times. And I always find it hard to answer. Recently I came across a post on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/perlprogrammers/">Facebook</a> which started the discussion once again. I am pleasantly surprised by some of the response to this question.</p>
<p>I am sure you must have come across, <a href="http://cpandashboard.com/">CPAN Dashboard</a>, by Dave Cross. I loved the idea. I have yet to try it myself, but I am certainly going to get my hands dirty soon. If you are a CPAN module author then please give it a go and share your experience with us. Let's make this as popular as CPAN itself.</p>
<p>On a similar note, Gabor Szabo, started the <a href="https://perlmaven.com/cpan-digger">CPAN Digger</a> project. I remember many years ago, Gabor shared the idea with me and wanted me to work on this. Unfortunately I never got around to it. I am so happy that it is finally arrived. It would be great if we all come along and help with the project.</p>
<p>A recent <a href="http://blogs.perl.org/users/samir_parikh/2020/11/perl-podcasts.html">post</a> by Samir Parikh, brought up the topic of "Perl Podcasts" once again. I still remember Lance Wicks and I discussed the subject during the Perl Conference in Glasgow in 2018. We even recorded our first interview together with a very popular face in the Perl commnunity. What a shame I couldn't give the attention it needed. I am still hopeful one day we will get it back in action.</p>
<p>Last but not least, how are the various forms of lockdown treating you in your own country? Please do look after yourself and your family. Enjoy the rest of the newsletter.</p></div>

  <title>Github Actions for Module::Install and showing error log on Linux, Mac OSX, and Windows</title>
  <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>
Earlier we saw how to create <a href="/github-actions-running-on-3-operating-systems">GitHub Actions to run on Linux, Windows, and Mac OSX</a>.
I used that idea on an old module of I maintain that is uses <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Module::Install">Module::Install</a> for packaging.
<p>
At first it failed due to missing Module::Install, and even though I had a guess of the source of the problem, I thought it would be a good
opportunity to check how could I see the content of the cpanm log files after a failing installation.

    <content type="html">&lt;h2 id="part-1"&gt;Part 1&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You are given an array of integers &lt;span class="citation" data-cites="N"&gt;@N&lt;/span&gt; and an integer $A. Write a script to find find if there exists a pair of elements in the array whose difference is $A. Print 1 if exists otherwise 0.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="solution"&gt;Solution&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="perl"&gt;
use strict;
use warnings;
##
# You are given an array of integers @N and an integer $A.
# Write a script to find find if there exists a pair of elements 
# in the array whose difference is $A.
# Print 1 if exists otherwise 0.
##
use boolean;
use Math::Combinatorics;

sub build_constraints{
    my @constraints;
    my $a_not_equal_b = sub { $_[0] != $_[1] };
    my $difference_equal_n = sub { $_[0] - $_[1] == $_[2] };
    return (
       $a_not_equal_b,
       $difference_equal_n
    );
}

MAIN:{
    my $combinations = Math::Combinatorics-&gt;new(
                           count =&gt; 2,
                           data =&gt; [@ARGV[1 .. @ARGV - 1]],
                       );
    my $found = false;  
    my ($check_equal, $check_difference) = build_constraints();           
    while(my @combination = $combinations-&gt;next_combination()){  
        if($check_equal-&gt;(@combination) &amp;&amp; $check_difference-&gt;(@combination, $ARGV[0])){
            $found = true;
            print "1\n"; last;
        }
    }
    print "0\n" if(!$found);
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3 id="sample-run"&gt;Sample Run&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="shell"&gt;
$ perl perl/ch-1.pl 15 10 30 20 50 40
0
$ perl perl/ch-1.pl 7 10 8 12 15 5
1
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3 id="notes"&gt;Notes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a fairly silly use of the &lt;em&gt;constraint programming&lt;/em&gt; approach I used &lt;a href="http://www.rabbitfarm.com/cgi-bin/blosxom/perl/2020/11/08"&gt;last week&lt;/a&gt;. Like last time I generate all combinations and test them using a filtering approach. The filter is an array of constraint functions. Here we just have two simple constraints though!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="part-2"&gt;Part 2&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You are given Sudoku puzzle (9x9). Write a script to complete the puzzle&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="notes-1"&gt;Notes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn’t have a chance to implement a solution in Perl. I would have used a similar constraint approach if I did. This is a natural use for Prolog and if you’re interested in reading in my Prolog implementation you can go &lt;a href="http://www.rabbitfarm.com/cgi-bin/blosxom/prolog/2020/11/15"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Hacktoberfest 2020 report</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://dev.to/zakame/hacktoberfest-2020-report-1p6i" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;FPBP!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I'm rather new here at dev.to and since Hacktoberfest 2020 has come and gone, I might as well get started doing a new blog here.  I've been doing Hacktoberfests for maybe a couple of years now, and while this year has seen &lt;a href="https://joel.net/how-one-guy-ruined-hacktoberfest2020-drama"&gt;quite the kerfuffle&lt;/a&gt;, that alone should not be enough reason to stop doing it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#background" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Background
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I work primarily with #perl stuff with bits of #docker and other tools in between, so most of my previous Hacktoberfests have focused on contributing to these.  For this year though, I wanted to learn and use #nix some more, especially as I found the idea of &lt;a href="https://nixos.org/guides/declarative-and-reproducible-developer-environments.html"&gt;reproducible developer environments&lt;/a&gt; across different machines to be interesting, and I've tried doing similar things (to mixed results) with Docker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To help both Nix and Perl efforts, I thought learning enough of Nixpkgs to port missing CPAN modules I want or need would be a good idea to start...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#contributions" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Contributions
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Hacktoberfest game approved these PRs:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="ltag_github-liquid-tag"&gt;

        &lt;/strong&gt; posted on &lt;a href="https://github.com/spwhitt/nix-zsh-completions/pull/37"&gt;&lt;time&gt;Oct 02, 2020&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="ltag-github-body"&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;nix-build explicitly documents --dry-run in its --help, while nix-shell
passes it onto nix-store --realise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="gh-btn-container"&gt;&lt;a class="gh-btn" href="https://github.com/spwhitt/nix-zsh-completions/pull/37"&gt;View on GitHub&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This got me started as I'm using zsh as my default shell, but the Nix tooling uses bash.  Having become an avid user of &lt;code&gt;nix-shell&lt;/code&gt;, I used the &lt;code&gt;--dry-run&lt;/code&gt; flag (which it passes down to &lt;code&gt;nix-store --realise&lt;/code&gt;) for estimating download sizes of stuff I want in the shell.  Since this particular flag was missing in the completion, it seemed easy enough to add it in with this PR, despite some other note about changing the implementation entirely for the new &lt;code&gt;nix&lt;/code&gt; command interface.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At my work, we're using &lt;a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Future::AsyncAwait"&gt;Future::AsyncAwait&lt;/a&gt; heavily, so I missed this somewhat in Nixpkgs enough to get me started learning how to port it from CPAN to Nixpkgs.  Porting is somewhat easy to do using &lt;a href="https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/blob/master/maintainers/scripts/nix-generate-from-cpan.pl"&gt;nix-generate-from-cpan&lt;/a&gt;, but the other half of work is testing if it actually builds using &lt;code&gt;nix-build&lt;/code&gt; to make additional changes if needed, and testing builds of other packages depending on it with &lt;a href="https://github.com/Mic92/nixpkgs-review"&gt;nixpkgs-review&lt;/a&gt; preferably on both Nix-enhanced Linux installs as well as on native NixOS and macOS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to &lt;a href="https://github.com/stigtsp"&gt;stigtsp&lt;/a&gt; for showing me the ropes!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This pure-Perl addon for &lt;a href="https://search.nixos.org/packages?show=perl532Packages.IOAsync&amp;amp;query=IOAsync&amp;amp;from=0&amp;amp;size=30&amp;amp;sort=relevance&amp;amp;channel=unstable#disabled" rel="nofollow"&gt;IO::Async&lt;/a&gt; extends it to allow creating TLS/SSL servers or clients via &lt;a href="https://search.nixos.org/packages?show=perl532Packages.IOSocketSSL&amp;amp;query=IOSocketSSL&amp;amp;from=0&amp;amp;size=30&amp;amp;sort=relevance&amp;amp;channel=unstable#disabled" rel="nofollow"&gt;IO::Socket::SSL&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a somewhat required module for other IO::Async-based code that connect/serve TLS/SSL resources, such as those in the &lt;a href="https://metacpan.org/search?size=20&amp;amp;q=Net%3A%3AAsync" rel="nofollow"&gt;Net::Async namespace&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Pretty much anything external that one can substantially reach with &lt;a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/IO::Async"&gt;IO::Async&lt;/a&gt; needs TLS/SSL, so missing this in Nixpkgs seems odd.  Adding it here seems a no-brainer, and would help in upcoming packages like &lt;code&gt;Net::Async::HTTP&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Net::Async::WebSocket&lt;/code&gt; (with the latter having pretty much a hard dependency for IO::Async::SSL anyway for working on anything non-trivial.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was a PR derived from an earlier more substantial work which was merged later, beyond the Hacktoberfest cutoff:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This replaces the old prettify.js highlighter with highlight.js.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
&lt;a id="user-content-motivation" class="anchor" href="#motivation"&gt;&lt;span class="octicon octicon-link"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Motivation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;prettify.js has long been abandoned by Google so we need to replace it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, highlight.js is also somewhat dormant (&lt;a href="https://github.com/highlightjs/highlight.js/issues/1678"&gt;https://github.com/highlightjs/highlight.js/issues/1678&lt;/a&gt;) but still sees enough activity to get around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
&lt;a id="user-content-references" class="anchor" href="#references"&gt;&lt;span class="octicon octicon-link"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;References&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an update of #737, fixes #1544.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the work was already done by @dotandimet, please give credit where due. I just updated it for latest Mojo and highlight.js 💪&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;This aids discovery of GLX capabilities on Intel-based setups for
e.g. glxinfo, alacritty, kitty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not sure if using &lt;code&gt;runCommand&lt;/code&gt; here is the right way, let me know if this needs revising, but it seems to work well enough for me...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This one came about as I was looking to replace KDE4 Konsole on my Slackware 14.2 with a more modern terminal, and tried both &lt;a href="https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty"&gt;Alacritty&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty"&gt;Kitty&lt;/a&gt;.  I eventually went with Kitty, but since this requires GPU acceleration I needed nixGL and Nixpkgs' own mesa_drivers as well.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;A few users of docker-perl have stumbled upon (and getting confused
with) the default /usr/bin/perl shipped by Debian, so put a short note
here explaining why it remains and also better describe how docker-perl
and its tooling is installed/configured.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This was a somewhat longstanding documentation issue on docker-perl (which I maintain for sometime now,) and since it was flaring up on and off again, might as well make the time to document this issue so people using the docker-perl image know what to expect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#progress" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Progress
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was able to do a good many more PRs this year than in previous years, but at the same time many of them weren't eligible for this time due to the changes in the Hacktoberfest game that supposedly ruined it for everyone.  OTOH, I never really actively sought for the reward(s), but rather the experience of this yearly adventure to do a bit more for Free and Open Source Software than what I usually do regularly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another thing that tempers my expectation for rewards is that I'd have to go waiting a few more months to receive it, &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; go through post office procedures which take a good hour or two to complete, which in this pandemic clown world would be a risk I'd rather not take...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#reflections" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Reflections
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Learning Nix and Nixpkgs through porting Perl modules to it was a great experience, and I hope to continue doing so beyond Hacktoberfest.  I'm particularly interested in making a reproducible Perl development environment more easier to do in Nix, maybe with some insight with sister languages like Ruby &lt;a href="https://github.com/nix-community/bundix"&gt;Bundix&lt;/a&gt; or Python &lt;a href="https://github.com/cript0nauta/pynixify"&gt;pynixify&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'll also be continuing some &lt;a href="https://github.com/Perl/docker-perl"&gt;docker-perl&lt;/a&gt; work, especially as frameworks like Mojolicious are keen to get onto the &lt;em&gt;cloud-native&lt;/em&gt; bandwagon (if not so already) in order to do easy, reproducible app deployments to Docker or Kubernetes; Nix may help yet again with that too, as it already has the tooling for exporting to Docker or OCI image formats.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Bang Bang</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://www.perl.com/article/bang-bang/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.perl.com/images/bang-bang/blackmagic.png" alt="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interpreters read and execute scripts (whereas shells are more like a kitchen pass-through and can either execute or hand over to another interpreter). When we specify interpreter on the command line, it is the one that will be used. For instance &lt;code&gt;Rscript script.R&lt;/code&gt; will execute &lt;em&gt;script.R&lt;/em&gt; using the &lt;code&gt;Rscript&lt;/code&gt; interpreter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we execute a file without explicitly giving an interpreter (for instance, like &lt;code&gt;./myscript.pl&lt;/code&gt;), it is the job of the &amp;ldquo;shebang&amp;rdquo; to tell to the shell/OS which interpreter to use. The shebang is that first line of a text file that starts with &lt;code&gt;#!&lt;/code&gt; and is followed by the interpreter path:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;#!/usr/bin/perl
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes we see the &lt;code&gt;env&lt;/code&gt; program, which finds the the first &lt;code&gt;perl&lt;/code&gt; in our path:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;#!/usr/bin/env perl
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;env&lt;/code&gt; does not split args therefore we can&amp;rsquo;t add options:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;#!/usr/bin/env perl -w&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, &lt;code&gt;env&lt;/code&gt; is not always located in &lt;code&gt;/usr/bin/env&lt;/code&gt; so it can guarantee some portability at machine/distribution level but not always between distributions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="perl-is-nice"&gt;Perl is nice&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;perl&lt;/code&gt; is not like other interpreters—its nice, even with challenges. &lt;code&gt;perl&lt;/code&gt; inspects the shebang to check if it&amp;rsquo;s really for it (and if not it hands our program over to another interpreter).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For instance the file &lt;em&gt;i-am-python.pl&lt;/em&gt; contains a Python program, which is definitely not Perl:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"&gt;&lt;code class="language-python" data-lang="python"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#75715e"&gt;#!/usr/bin/python&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span style="color:#f92672"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; os
&lt;span style="color:#f92672"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; time

&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span style="color:#e6db74"&gt;&amp;#34;I&amp;#39;m a snake : &amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color:#f92672"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; os&lt;span style="color:#f92672"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;environ[&lt;span style="color:#e6db74"&gt;&amp;#34;SHELL&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;] &lt;span style="color:#f92672"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color:#e6db74"&gt;&amp;#34; &amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color:#f92672"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; os&lt;span style="color:#f92672"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;environ[&lt;span style="color:#e6db74"&gt;&amp;#34;_&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;])

&lt;span style="color:#75715e"&gt;# Keep it alive to have time to inspect with ps&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef"&gt;while&lt;/span&gt; True:
    time&lt;span style="color:#f92672"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;sleep(&lt;span style="color:#ae81ff"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously we don&amp;rsquo;t care about the extension as it does not mean any kind of file association (although some systems let you associate it). So we have a &lt;em&gt;.pl&lt;/em&gt; file and we execute it with &lt;code&gt;perl&lt;/code&gt; but inside we have a &lt;code&gt;python&lt;/code&gt; shebang and some python code. It&amp;rsquo;s clearly not a valid Perl file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you don&amp;rsquo;t believe me, check this with a quick syntax check &lt;code&gt;perl -c i-am-python.pl&lt;/code&gt; that tells us it isn&amp;rsquo;t valid Perl:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ perl -c i-am-python.pl
syntax error at i-am-python.pl line 3, near &amp;quot;import time&amp;quot;
i-am-python.pl had compilation errors.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we execute this file with perl, surprisingly, everything goes fine. How did that happen? &lt;code&gt;perl&lt;/code&gt; is smart enough to give the script to &lt;code&gt;python&lt;/code&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ perl i-am-python.pl
I'm a snake : /bin/bash /usr/bin/perl
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And if we want to check which interpreter really runs this script, we can look in the process table:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"&gt;&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"&gt;$ ps aux | grep &lt;span style="color:#e6db74"&gt;&amp;#34;i-am-pytho[n].pl&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;
tduponc+  &lt;span style="color:#ae81ff"&gt;5647&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span style="color:#ae81ff"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;.0  &lt;span style="color:#ae81ff"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;.0  &lt;span style="color:#ae81ff"&gt;33208&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span style="color:#ae81ff"&gt;7024&lt;/span&gt; pts/0    S    &lt;span style="color:#ae81ff"&gt;13&lt;/span&gt;:04   &lt;span style="color:#ae81ff"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;:00 /usr/bin/python i-am-python.pl&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that &lt;code&gt;i-am-pytho[n].pl&lt;/code&gt; with the brackets, which puts the &lt;code&gt;n&lt;/code&gt; in a character class. That&amp;rsquo;s a nifty trick so &lt;code&gt;grep&lt;/code&gt; finds the line with &lt;code&gt;python&lt;/code&gt; but not the &lt;code&gt;grep&lt;/code&gt; process itself because that pattern won&amp;rsquo;t match a literal &lt;code&gt;[&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t forget to kill the program since it&amp;rsquo;s sleeping forever!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, what if we want to test the converse and run Perl code with a &lt;code&gt;python&lt;/code&gt; interpreter?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"&gt;&lt;code class="language-perl" data-lang="perl"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#75715e"&gt;#!/usr/bin/perl&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef"&gt;my&lt;/span&gt; $str &lt;span style="color:#f92672"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color:#e6db74"&gt;&amp;#34;I&amp;#39;m a jewel&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;;
&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color:#e6db74"&gt;&amp;#34;$str : $ENV{SHELL} $ENV{_}\n&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;;

&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef"&gt;while&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;span style="color:#ae81ff"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;) { sleep &lt;span style="color:#ae81ff"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;; }&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a valid Perl file but the &lt;code&gt;python&lt;/code&gt; interpreter does not hand over to &lt;code&gt;perl&lt;/code&gt; and just returns a Python error:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"&gt;&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"&gt;$ python i-am-perl.py
  File &lt;span style="color:#e6db74"&gt;&amp;#34;iamperl.py&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;, line &lt;span style="color:#ae81ff"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;
    my $str &lt;span style="color:#f92672"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color:#e6db74"&gt;&amp;#34;I&amp;#39;m a jewel&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;;
       ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is special to Python. Try it yourself with bash, Ruby, or something else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="i-have-something-for-you"&gt;I have something for you&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having the correct interpreter on the command line does not mean that the shebang is totally ignored. &lt;code&gt;perl&lt;/code&gt; is once again super smart and behaves exactly as we can imagine (DWIM). For instance, what if we put a warning switch (&lt;code&gt;-w&lt;/code&gt;) in the shebang, like in this file &lt;em&gt;override-bang.pl&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"&gt;&lt;code class="language-perl" data-lang="perl"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#75715e"&gt;#!/usr/bin/perl -w&lt;/span&gt;

$str &lt;span style="color:#f92672"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color:#e6db74"&gt;&amp;#34;will produce a warning&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though we don&amp;rsquo;t put the &lt;code&gt;-w&lt;/code&gt; on the command line, we still get warnings:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"&gt;&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"&gt;$ perl override-bang.pl
Name &lt;span style="color:#e6db74"&gt;&amp;#34;main::str&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt; used only once: possible typo at override-bang.pl line &lt;span style="color:#ae81ff"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="plenty-is-no-plague"&gt;Plenty is no plague&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, what if we specify some switches on the command line and some others in the shebang? &lt;strong&gt;SPOILER&lt;/strong&gt;: they are simply merged together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we run &lt;code&gt;perl -c overridebang.pl&lt;/code&gt; to check a syntactically-valid file, we get the switches from the command line and the shebang line. We get a &lt;code&gt;perl -cw&lt;/code&gt; execution:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"&gt;&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"&gt;Name &lt;span style="color:#e6db74"&gt;&amp;#34;main::str&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt; used only once: possible typo at override-bang.pl line &lt;span style="color:#ae81ff"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;.
override-bang.pl syntax OK&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What if we have conflicting options like &lt;code&gt;-w&lt;/code&gt; to enable warnings and &lt;code&gt;-X&lt;/code&gt; to disable them? Here&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;enable-warnings.pl&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"&gt;&lt;code class="language-perl" data-lang="perl"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#75715e"&gt;#!/usr/bin/perl -w&lt;/span&gt;

$str &lt;span style="color:#f92672"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color:#e6db74"&gt;&amp;#34;will produce a warning&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we run this on its own, we get a warning as expected:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ perl enable-warnings.pl
Name &amp;quot;main::str&amp;quot; used only once: possible typo at warnings.pl line 3.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we add &lt;code&gt;-X&lt;/code&gt; on the command line, there is no output:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ perl -X enable-warnings.pl
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How about the other way around with &lt;code&gt;-X&lt;/code&gt; on the shebang? Here&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;disable-warnings.pl&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"&gt;&lt;code class="language-perl" data-lang="perl"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#75715e"&gt;#!/usr/bin/perl -X&lt;/span&gt;

$str &lt;span style="color:#f92672"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color:#e6db74"&gt;&amp;#34;will produce a warning&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we run this with &lt;code&gt;-w&lt;/code&gt;, we still don&amp;rsquo;t get output:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ perl -X enable-warnings.pl
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;-X&lt;/code&gt; always turns off warnings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The shebang (&lt;code&gt;-X&lt;/code&gt;) is taken in priority versus the command line and no warning is reported. It&amp;rsquo;s the same if we execute the file with &lt;code&gt;perl -W disable-warnings.pl&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We could imagine that&amp;rsquo;s a rule to resolve conflicts with &amp;ldquo;last seen&amp;rdquo; parameter but wait, it&amp;rsquo;s not that simple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How about &lt;code&gt;-X&lt;/code&gt; versus &lt;code&gt;-W&lt;/code&gt;, which enables all warnings? Who wins then? It turns out that the last on defined wins. We can see that right on the command line:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ perl -W -X -e '$str = &amp;quot;will produce a warning&amp;quot;'
$ perl -X -W -e '$str = &amp;quot;will produce a warning&amp;quot;'
Name &amp;quot;main::str&amp;quot; used only once: possible typo at -e line 1.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an exercise for the reader, try the different combinations of taint checking options: &lt;code&gt;-T&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;-U&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="a-magic-incantation"&gt;A magic incantation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes we see some odd lines at the beginning of Perl programs. What the hell is this black magic? This is actually very smart opening is &amp;ldquo;polyglot&amp;rdquo; and correct for both shells (with or without shebang support) and &lt;code&gt;perl&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;#!/usr/bin/perl
eval 'exec /usr/bin/perl -S $0 ${1+&amp;quot;$@&amp;quot;}'
    if $running_under_some_shell;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we start the script with &lt;code&gt;perl&lt;/code&gt;, the job is done and &lt;code&gt;perl&lt;/code&gt; executes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;eval 'exec /usr/bin/perl -S $0 ${1+&amp;quot;$@&amp;quot;}'
if $running_under_some_shell;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That &lt;code&gt;$running_under_some_shell&lt;/code&gt; has no value, so the code translate to a false conditional. This line is ignored and the rest of the file is interpreted normally.:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;eval 'exec /usr/bin/perl -S $0 ${1+&amp;quot;$@&amp;quot;} if 0;'
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What if we start the script with a shell that recognizes the shebang? The shell does the handover to &lt;code&gt;perl&lt;/code&gt;, which then reads the first line (shebang then &lt;code&gt;eval ...&lt;/code&gt;). The execution flow is then the same than above (magic incantation does nothing and file is interpreted). Nothing surprising there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what if we started the script with a shell that does not recognize the shebang so no handover occurs right away? This is actually where this magic is useful. The shell will ignore first line and will never reach third line. Why will it never reach third line? A newline terminates the shell command and &lt;code&gt;exec&lt;/code&gt; will replace the current execution by &lt;code&gt;perl&lt;/code&gt;. The rest of the script doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter after that &lt;code&gt;exec&lt;/code&gt;. Our code changes from this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;#!/usr/bin/perl
eval 'exec /usr/bin/perl -S $0 ${1+&amp;quot;$@&amp;quot;}'
    if $running_under_some_shell;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;to effectively this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;eval 'exec /usr/bin/perl -S $0 ${1+&amp;quot;$@&amp;quot;}'
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those &lt;code&gt;$0&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;$@&lt;/code&gt; are shell words for the script name and arguments
and the &lt;code&gt;-S&lt;/code&gt; tells &lt;code&gt;perl&lt;/code&gt; look for the value in &lt;code&gt;$0&lt;/code&gt; using PATH environment variable. (&lt;a href="https://perldoc.perl.org/perlrun.html#Command-Switches"&gt;perldoc&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="x-is-fun"&gt;-x is fun&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ve had fun with the &lt;code&gt;perl&lt;/code&gt; interpreter and the shebang, but &lt;code&gt;perl&lt;/code&gt; has a &lt;code&gt;-x&lt;/code&gt; which is already fun by design. This option tells Perl that the program to execute is actually embedded in a larger chunk of unrelated text to ignore. Perhaps the Perl program is in the middle of an email message:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;quot;I do not know if it is what you want, but it is what you get.
        -- Larry Wall&amp;quot;

#!/usr/bin/env perl

print &amp;quot;perl -x ignores everything before shebang\n&amp;quot;;
print &amp;lt;DATA&amp;gt;;

__END__

&amp;quot;Fortunately, it is easier to keep an old interpreter around than an
old computer.
        -- Larry Wall&amp;quot;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Executing this as a program is a syntax error because the Larry Wall quote before the shebang is not valid Perl. When we execute this code with &lt;code&gt;perl -x&lt;/code&gt;, everything before the shebang is ignored and it works:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"&gt;&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"&gt;$ perl -x email.txt
perl -x ignores everything before shebang

&lt;span style="color:#e6db74"&gt;&amp;#34;Fortunately, it is easier to keep an old interpreter around than an
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:#e6db74"&gt;old computer.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:#e6db74"&gt;        -- Larry Wall&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Out of curiosity, what if we tried to go one step further? How about multiple shebangs in a file, where one of them has a &lt;code&gt;-x&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"&gt;&lt;code class="language-perl" data-lang="perl"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#75715e"&gt;#!/usr/bin/perl -x&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span style="color:#75715e"&gt;#!/usr/bin/perl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it only produces an error:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Can't emulate -x on #! line.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is however a trick to achieve this, by using shell &lt;code&gt;eval&lt;/code&gt;. That &lt;code&gt;perl -x&lt;/code&gt; is now executed in a shell process and not interpreted by perl binary like previously.:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"&gt;&lt;code class="language-perl" data-lang="perl"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#75715e"&gt;#!/bin/sh&lt;/span&gt;
eval &lt;span style="color:#e6db74"&gt;&amp;#39;exec perl -x $0 ${1+&amp;#34;$@&amp;#34;}&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
die &lt;span style="color:#e6db74"&gt;&amp;#34;another day&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;; exit &lt;span style="color:#ae81ff"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span style="color:#75715e"&gt;#!perl&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color:#e6db74"&gt;&amp;#34;$]\n&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="startperl"&gt;startperl&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This article would not be complete without discussing a bit about the config variable &lt;code&gt;$Config{startperl}&lt;/code&gt;. This variable comes from &lt;em&gt;Config.pm&lt;/em&gt;  that provides information about configuration environment (which you also see with &lt;code&gt;perl -V&lt;/code&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"&gt;&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"&gt;$ perl -e &lt;span style="color:#e6db74"&gt;&amp;#39;use Config; print $Config{startperl}&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span style="color:#75715e"&gt;#!/usr/bin/perl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is actually built during compilation from defaults or user/vendor provided configs. What if we want a different value? Simply specify the value of this during the &lt;code&gt;./Configure&lt;/code&gt; step, the configure option is &lt;code&gt;-Dstartperl='...'&lt;/code&gt;. We then need to rebuild &lt;code&gt;perl&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"&gt;&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"&gt;$ ./Configure -des -Dstartperl&lt;span style="color:#f92672"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:#e6db74"&gt;&amp;#39;#!/my/shebang&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
$ make test install&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now our custom value is the default:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"&gt;&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"&gt;$ perl -e &lt;span style="color:#e6db74"&gt;&amp;#39;use Config; print $Config{startperl}&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span style="color:#75715e"&gt;#!/my/shebang&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/ExtUtils::MakeMaker
"&gt;ExtUtils::MakeMaker&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Module::Build
"&gt;Module::Build&lt;/a&gt; seems also to use &lt;code&gt;startperl&lt;/code&gt; among other methods to fix modules shebangs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take care to use an interpreter or a program that behaves like a &lt;code&gt;perl&lt;/code&gt; interpreter! Some CPAN modules use &lt;code&gt;startperl&lt;/code&gt; to write first line of generated perl tests. The &lt;code&gt;/usr/bin/env&lt;/code&gt; limitation still apply here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I decided to try a &lt;em&gt;constraint programming&lt;/em&gt; approach for this. While there are several modules for doing this available on CPAN I didn’t want to quite go so deep down that rabbithole. Instead I took the simpler path of implementing each constraint as a subroutine stored in an array. For each candidate combination the constraints are tests. Since all constraints must be satisfied if any one returns a false value then we can move immediately to the next combination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="part-2"&gt;Part 2&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You are given a positive integer $N. Write a script to find if it can be expressed as a ** b where a &amp;gt; 0 and b &amp;gt; 1. Print 1 if you succeed otherwise 0.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="solution-1"&gt;Solution&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="perl"&gt;
use strict;
use warnings;
##
# You are given a positive integer $N.
# Write a script to find if it can be expressed
# as a ^ b where a &gt; 0 and b &gt; 1. 
# Print 1 if you succeed otherwise 0.
##
use boolean;

sub log_a{
    my($a, $n) = @_;
    return log($n)/log($a);
}

MAIN:{
    my $N = $ARGV[0];
    my $found = false;                  
    for my $a (2 .. $N){ 
        my $b = log_a($a, $N);
        if($b =~ /^[-]?\d+$/ &amp;&amp; $b &gt; 1){ 
            print "1\n";
            $found = true;
            last;
        }
    }
    print "0\n" if(!$found);
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3 id="sample-run-1"&gt;Sample Run&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="shell"&gt;
$ perl perl/ch-2.pl 7
0
$ perl perl/ch-2.pl 9
1
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3 id="notes-1"&gt;Notes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was tempted to repeat roughly the same design as Part 1 and use constraints but that really would be over engineering it! Instead here we just loop over all possible values &lt;code&gt;$a&lt;/code&gt; and test using logarithms to see if &lt;code&gt;$b&lt;/code&gt; holds an integer value. There seems to be a number of ways to do the test to determine if a scalar holds an integer but a regex seems maybe the most idiomatically Perlish way.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

     <p>Jason McIntosh has shared his progress on Perl 7 documentation standards for the month of October, and has delivered his final report on the grant:</p>

<p><em>"October saw me very busy with the documentation standards project. After continuing the research I began in September, I spent much of the month writing a draft style guide to which I’ve given the filename “perldocstyle.pod”. Per my project proposal, I did seek comment on it from both within and outside the Perl community; this included my hiring a freelance style-guide editor to review the document.</em></p>

<p><em>"Midway through the month, I shared a request-for-comments report with P5P, including a couple of examples where I apply the proposed standards two two extant Perl man pages. This is at https://jmac.org/misc/perldoc/. In that RFC, I also propose the creation of a new documentation-focused sub-project within the larger Perl project, which would have its own dedicated team or manager. Obviously, I’m keeping the deliverables of this project scoped to just the style guide—but since I noticed that literally every project other than Perl that I visited during my research paired its style guide with a dedicated documentation team, I felt obliged to attach this recommendation to the project at hand.</em></p>

<p><em>"At month’s end, I submitted perldocstyle.pod as a pull request to the Perl project, proposing it as a new porting document. I have responded to code-review comments that porters have offered so far, and intend to continue working with P5P to see this file through to whatever its ultimate fate in the Perl repository might be. I’ve meanwhile declined to make additional pull requests from my updated-document examples, since doing so before these new standards’ ratification (via permanent acceptance into the repository) seems premature.</em></p>

<p><em>"As such, I consider this project delivered.</em></p>

<p><em>"Feedback from the community has been quite positive. Most people who have commented on the proposal express support for a focused documentation project within Perl. Several people stated a willingness to be part of whatever documentation-focused sub-project might result. Lively discussion and debate occurred on the P5P mailing list over the specifics of some of the proposed standards, which I take as a positive sign that Perl’s present stewards care very much about the quality of the language’s core documentation, and wish to actively improve it rather than simply let it passively accrue."</em></p>

&lt;p&gt;Before starting this I did a little research and found some interesting articles. This &lt;a href="https://www.perlmonks.org/?node_id=303146"&gt;Perlmonks thread&lt;/a&gt; covers the topic on the size in bytes of integers in Perl. This &lt;a href="https://www.perlmonks.org/?node_id=45950"&gt;thread&lt;/a&gt; gets into how to detect overflow. In this challenge, however, we don’t need to really know any of this since the perl I am using (5.28.0) on my Mac Mini (running OS X) can easily accomodate much larger numbers than the 32-bit signed restriction placed here. All that need be done is check to see if the number is above or below this maximum/minimum.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You are given a string $S with 3 or more words. Write a script to find the length of the string except the first and last words ignoring whitespace.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anytime I need to count characters I immediately think of &lt;a href="https://perldoc.perl.org/functions/tr"&gt;tr&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;code&gt;tr&lt;/code&gt; will, of course, do character replacements but it’s return value is the number of characters which have been effected. Here with the &lt;code&gt;d&lt;/code&gt; option the matching characters are just deleted. This code would work exactly just as well with the &lt;code&gt;d&lt;/code&gt; but I figured it’d be actually less confusing to have it there and make it more clear what it was doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="part-2"&gt;Part 2&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You are given an array &lt;span class="citation" data-cites="A"&gt;@A&lt;/span&gt; of positive numbers. Write a script to flip the sign of some members of the given array so that the sum of the all members is minimum non-negative.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a brute force approach. I use the same method for generating all combinations that I used in &lt;a href="http://www.rabbitfarm.com/cgi-bin/blosxom/2020/09/13#pwc077"&gt;Challenge 077&lt;/a&gt; with the variation that here I use the generated combination to determine which elements of the list are to be flipped. After calculating the sum of each new list (with flipped elements) I check to see if this is a new minimum positive value and, if so, if it has been done with fewer flips.&lt;/p&gt;</content>
