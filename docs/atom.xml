        <![CDATA[<p>These are some answers to the Week 137 of the <a href="https://perlweeklychallenge.org/blog/perl-weekly-challenge-137/">Perl Weekly Challenge</a> organized by <a href="http://blogs.perl.org/users/mohammad_s_anwar/">Mohammad S. Anwar</a>.</p>

<p><em>Spoiler Alert:</em> This weekly challenge deadline is due in a few days from now (on November 7, 2021 at 24:00). This blog post offers some solutions to this challenge, please don’t read on if you intend to complete the challenge on your own.</p>

<h2>Task 1: Long Year</h2>

<p><em>Write a script to find all the years between 1900 and 2100 which is a Long Year.</em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>A year is Long if it has 53 weeks.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Expected Output:</em></p>

<pre><code>1903, 1908, 1914, 1920, 1925,
1931, 1936, 1942, 1948, 1953,
1959, 1964, 1970, 1976, 1981,
1987, 1992, 1998, 2004, 2009,
2015, 2020, 2026, 2032, 2037,
2043, 2048, 2054, 2060, 2065,
2071, 2076, 2082, 2088, 2093,
2099
</code></pre>

<p>All years have 52 weeks, plus 1 day, or 2 days for leap years. How can you have years with 53 weeks? Well, it depends on how you define weeks. The most common convention is the following: all weeks start with Monday and each week belongs in the year in which the Thursday falls. This means that if the year starts on a Thursday or is a leap year and starts on a Wednesday, that particular year will have 53 numbered weeks.</p>

<h3>Long Year in Raku</h3>

<p>For this task, we use the built-in <code>DateTime</code> module, and the <code>day-of-week</code> and <code>is-leap-year</code> methods provided by the <a href="https://docs.raku.org/type/Dateish">dateish</a> role. We simply loop over the <code>1900-2100</code> range and print out the year if it starts on a Thursday, or if it starts on a Wednesday and is a leap year.</p>

<pre><code>use v6;

for 1900..2100 -&gt; $y {
    my $year = DateTime.new(:year($y));
    my $new-year-day = Date.new("$y-01-01").day-of-week;
    print "$y, " if $new-year-day == 4; # DoW 4 = Thursday
    print "$y, " if $year.is-leap-year and $new-year-day == 3;
}
say "";
</code></pre>

<p>This program displays the following output (slightly reformatted for the purpose of this blog post):</p>

<pre><code>$ raku ./53-week-year.raku
1903, 1908, 1914, 1920, 1925, 1931, 1936, 
1942, 1948, 1953, 1959, 1964, 1970, 1976, 
1981, 1987, 1992, 1998, 2004, 2009, 2015, 
2020, 2026, 2032, 2037, 2043, 2048, 2054, 
2060, 2065, 2071, 2076, 2082, 2088, 2093, 
2099,
</code></pre>

<p><em>Update (Nov. 2, 2021):</em> This can be made significantly simpler. Andrew Shitov sent me a message suggesting to use the <code>week-number</code> method (which is provided by the <a href="https://docs.raku.org/type/Dateish">dateish</a> role). All we need to do is to check whether the week number of the last day of the year is 53 (no need to check whether the year is leap). This can be done in just one code line, for example:</p>

<pre><code>.say if Date.new($_, 12, 31).week-number == 53 for 1900..2100;
</code></pre>

<h3>Long Year in Perl</h3>

<p>In Perl, we use the <code>Time::Local</code> core module to figure out whether a year starts on a Thursday (or on a Wednesday in the case of leap years). Since Perl doesn&#8217;t have a built-in function for finding out whether a year is leap, we roll out our own <code>is_leap_year</code> subroutine. A year is leap if it is evenly divisible by 4 and not by 100 (unless it is also divisible by 400), so that 1900 and 2100 are not leap, but 2000 is leap.</p>

<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/perl
use strict;
use warnings;
use feature qw/say/;
use Time::Local;

sub is_leap_year {
    my $year = shift;
    return 0 if $year % 4;   # not divisible by 4
    return 1 if $year % 100; # divisible by 4, not by 100
    return 0 if $year % 400; # divisible by 100, not by 400
    return 1;                # divisible by 400
}

for my $year (1900..2100) {
    my $date = timegm(0, 0, 0, 1, 0, $year);
    my $day_in_week = (gmtime $date)[6];
    print $year, ", " if $day_in_week == 4; # 4 = Thursday
    print $year, ", " if $day_in_week == 3 and is_leap_year $year;
}
say "";
</code></pre>

<p>This program displays the following output (sligthly reformatted for the purpose of this blog post):</p>

<pre><code>$ perl ./53-week-year.pl
1903, 1908, 1914, 1920, 1925, 1931, 1936, 
1942, 1948, 1953, 1959, 1964, 1970, 1976, 
1981, 1987, 1992, 1998, 2004, 2009, 2015, 
2020, 2026, 2032, 2037, 2043, 2048, 2054, 
2060, 2065, 2071, 2076, 2082, 2088, 2093, 
2099,
</code></pre>

<h2>Task 2: Lychrel Number</h2>

<p><em>You are given a number, 10 &lt;= $n &lt;= 1000.</em></p>

<p><em>Write a script to find out if the given number is Lychrel number. To keep the task simple, we impose the following rules:</em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>a. Stop if the number of iterations reached 500.</em>
<em>b. Stop if you end up with number >= 10_000_000.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>According to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lychrel_number">wikipedia</a>:</em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>A Lychrel number is a natural number that cannot form a palindrome through the iterative process of repeatedly reversing its digits and adding the resulting numbers.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Example 1:</em></p>

<pre><code>Input: $n = 56
Output: 0

After 1 iteration, we found palindrome number.
56 + 65 = 121
</code></pre>

<p><em>Example 2:</em></p>

<pre><code>Input: $n = 57
Output: 0

After 2 iterations, we found palindrome number.
 57 +  75 = 132
132 + 231 = 363
</code></pre>

<p><em>Example 3:</em></p>

<pre><code>Input: $n = 59
Output: 0

After 3 iterations, we found palindrome number.
 59 +  95 =  154
154 + 451 =  605
605 + 506 = 1111
</code></pre>

<p>It is now known whether there exists any Lychrel number in base ten, but some integers, such as 196, 295, and 394, are conjectured to be Lychrel numbers. They are sometimes called Lichrel candidates.</p>

<p>Note that the <em>(a)</em> stopping condition on the number of iterations is somewhat useless here, as we will reach the condition on the maximum size of the integer much faster. Starting with 1, the smallest positive integer, and applying the reverse and add algorithm will lead to a number larger than 10,000,000 is less than 20 iterations, as shown in the following Perl one-liner:</p>

<pre><code>$ perl -E '$n = 1; for $i (1..500) { $n += reverse $n; say $i and last if $n &gt;= 10_000_000;}'
19
</code></pre>

<h3>Lychrel Numbers in Raku</h3>

<p>We start with a <code>1..500</code> loop and break out of it if we&#8217;ve found a palindrome or if we&#8217;ve reached the 10,000,000 limit. In Raku, the built-in to reverse a word (or a number) is the <code>flip</code> method, which we use both for reversing the number and for finding out whether a result is a palindrome.</p>

<pre><code>use v6;

sub is-lychrel (UInt $m) {
    my $n = $m;
    for 1..500 -&gt; $i {
        return "$m is a Lychrel candidate. Reached the 1e7 limit"
            if $n &gt; 10_000_000;
        $n += $n.flip;
        #`[say $n and] return 0 if $n == $n.flip;
    }
    return "$m is a lychrel candidate (made 500 iterations)";
}
for 10...20, 30, 50, 100, 196 -&gt; $test {
    say "$test -&gt; ", is-lychrel $test;
}
</code></pre>

<p>This program displays the following output:</p>

<pre><code>$ raku ./lychrel.raku

10 -&gt; 0
11 -&gt; 0
12 -&gt; 0
13 -&gt; 0
14 -&gt; 0
15 -&gt; 0
16 -&gt; 0
17 -&gt; 0
18 -&gt; 0
19 -&gt; 0
20 -&gt; 0
30 -&gt; 0
50 -&gt; 0
100 -&gt; 0
196 -&gt; 196 is a Lychrel candidate. Reached the 1e7 limit
</code></pre>

<h3>Lychrel Numbers in Perl</h3>

<p>We&#8217;re using essentially the same algorithm as in Raku. In Perl, we use the <code>reverse</code> built-in function.</p>

<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/perl
use strict;
use warnings;
use feature qw/say/;

sub is_lychrel {
    my $m = shift;
    my $n = $m;
    for my $i (1..500) {
        return "$m is a Lychrel candidate. Reached the 1e7 limit" 
            if $n &gt; 10_000_000;
        $n += reverse $n;
        return 0 if $n == reverse $n;
    }
    return "$m is a lychrel candidate (made 500 iterations)";
}
for my $test (10..20, 30, 50, 100, 196) {
    say "$test -&gt; ", is_lychrel $test;
}
</code></pre>

<p>This program displays the following output:</p>

<pre><code>$ perl ./lychrel.pl
10 -&gt; 0
11 -&gt; 0
12 -&gt; 0
13 -&gt; 0
14 -&gt; 0
15 -&gt; 0
16 -&gt; 0
17 -&gt; 0
18 -&gt; 0
19 -&gt; 0
20 -&gt; 0
30 -&gt; 0
50 -&gt; 0
100 -&gt; 0
196 -&gt; 196 is a Lychrel candidate. Reached the 1e7 limit
</code></pre>

    <title>Some thoughts on Perl template processing</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://dev.to/mjgardner/some-thoughts-on-perl-template-processing-3p2i" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template_processor">Template processors and engines</a> are one of those pieces of software where it seems every developer wants to reinvent the wheel. Goodness knows I’ve done it earlier in my career. Tell me if this sounds familiar:</p>

<ol>
<li>You need to mix data into a document so you start with Perl’s string interpolation in <code>"</code>double quotes<code>"</code> or <a href="https://perldoc.perl.org/functions/sprintf"><code>sprintf</code></a> formats. (Or maybe you investigate <a href="https://perldoc.perl.org/perlform"><code>format</code>s</a>, but the <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Perl::Critic::Policy::Miscellanea::ProhibitFormats">less said about them the better</a>.)</li>
<li>You realize your documents need to display things based on certain conditions, or you want to loop over a list or some other structure.</li>
<li>You add these features via keyword parsing and escape characters, thinking it’s OK since this is just a small bespoke project.</li>
<li>Before you know it you’ve invented another <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language">domain-specific language</a> (DSL) and have to support it on top of the application you were trying to deliver in the first place.</li>
</ol>

<p>Stop. Just stop. Decades of others who have walked this same path have already done this for you. Especially if you’re using a web framework like <a href="https://www.perldancer.org/">Dancer</a>, <a href="https://mojolicious.org/">Mojolicious</a>, or <a href="http://www.catalystframework.org/">Catalyst</a>, where the template processor is either built-in or pluggable from <a href="https://www.cpan.org/">CPAN</a>. Even if you’re not developing a web application there are several general-purpose options of various capabilities like <a href="http://www.template-toolkit.org/">Template Toolkit</a> and <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Template::Mustache">Template::Mustache</a>. Investigate the alternatives and determine if they have the features, performance, and support you need. If you’re sure none of them truly meet your unique requirements, then maybe, <em>maybe</em> consider rolling your own.</p>

<p>Whatever you decide, realize that as your application or website grows your investment in that selection will only deepen. Porting to a new template processor can be as challenging as porting any source code to a new programming language.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, there are about as many opinions on how to choose a template processor as there are template processors. For example, in 2013 Roland Koehler wrote a <a href="http://www.simple-is-better.org/template/index.html">good Python-oriented article on several considerations and the different approaches available</a>. Although he ended up developing his own (<em>quelle surprise</em>), he makes a good case that a template processor ought to at least provide various logic constructs as well as embedded expressions, if not a full programming language. Koehler specifically warns against the latter, though, as a template developer might change an application’s data model, to say nothing of the possibility of executing arbitrary destructive code.</p>

<p>I can appreciate this reasoning. I’ve successfully used Perl template processors like the aforementioned <a href="http://www.template-toolkit.org/">Template::Toolkit</a> (which has both logic <a href="http://www.template-toolkit.org/docs/manual/Directives.html">directives</a> and an <a href="http://www.tt2.org/docs/manual/Config.html#section_EVAL_PERL">optional</a> facility for <a href="http://www.tt2.org/docs/manual/Directives.html#section_PERL">evaluating Perl code</a>) and <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Text::Xslate">Text::Xslate</a> (which supports <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Text::Xslate#TEMPLATE-SYNTAX">several template syntaxes</a> including a <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Text::Xslate::Syntax::TTerse">subset of Template::Toolkit</a>’, but without the ability to embed Perl code). We use the latter at work combined with <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Text::Xslate::Bridge::TT2Like">Text::Xslate::Bridge::TT2Like</a>’s emulation of various Template::Toolkit <a href="http://www.template-toolkit.org/docs/manual/VMethods.html">virtual methods</a> and it’s served us well.</p>

<p>But using those modules’ DSLs means more sophisticated tasks need extra time and effort finding the correct logic and expressions. This also assumes that their designer(s) have anticipated my needs either through built-in features or extensions. I’m already writing Perl; why should I switch to another, more limited language and environment provided I can remain disciplined enough to avoid issues like those described above by Koehler?</p>

<p>So for my personal projects, I favor template processors that use the full power of the Perl language like Mojolicious’ <a href="https://docs.mojolicious.org/Mojolicious/Guides/Rendering#Embedded-Perl">embedded Perl</a> renderer or the venerable <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Text::Template">Text::Template</a> for non-web applications. It saves me time and I’ll likely want more than any DSL can provide. This may not apply to your situation, though, and I’m open to counter-arguments.</p>

<p>What’s your favorite template processor and why? Let me know in the comments.</p>

    <title>Book review "Mastering Perl"</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://dev.to/thibaultduponchelle/book-review-mastering-perl-1bmo" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--jQoMngwj--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/2t33a9d2rkmicle13i3k.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--jQoMngwj--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/2t33a9d2rkmicle13i3k.jpg" alt="Mastering Perl" width="880" height="1173"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/mastering-perl/9780596527242/"&gt;Mastering Perl&lt;/a&gt; is a book from &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_d_foy"&gt;brian d foy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you like this post, read my other &lt;a href="https://dev.to/thibaultduponchelle/about-perl-books-review-1cj6"&gt;Perl books reviews&lt;/a&gt; 😀&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#becoming-a-perl-master"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Becoming a Perl master
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a good paragraph title because this is what this book is about, to make you a better programmer and particularly a better Perl programmer. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The goal is even more fairly high since it aims to (give you hints) to make you a &lt;em&gt;master&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--1OCZZ_Lw--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ulwoh9w8b4pl4wt9qdgv.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--1OCZZ_Lw--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ulwoh9w8b4pl4wt9qdgv.jpg" alt="Splinter" width="474" height="592"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is an interesting introduction about how to become a master &lt;em&gt;in general&lt;/em&gt;, how it involves studying methods from multiple masters, working on a masterpiece and knowing multiple languages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#book-structure"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Book structure
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The book is composed of a serie of totally independent chapters. Each chapter focuses on one topic and has the same structure: a kind of introduction, the main content with paragraphs, a list of resources and a conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of names dropping and references so you can continue your path to mastering 😀&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reading this book requires to know Perl basics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#regex"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Regex
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regex as first chapter is a bit rough 😀 but there are a lot of interesting bits like explanations about modifiers, &lt;code&gt;lookahead&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;lookbehind&lt;/code&gt;, the &lt;code&gt;use re "debug";&lt;/code&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#security"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Security
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This chapter suffers from being old (the book I have into my hands was published in 2007) and all topics are very well known today (but does not mean they are no longer true).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I enjoyed the description of different forms of system calls and the explanation about setuid. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#debugging-perl"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Debugging Perl
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of very nice tricks here, like &lt;code&gt;redefine&lt;/code&gt; or wrapping subs or even using &lt;code&gt;-d&lt;/code&gt; for a &lt;code&gt;Devel::&lt;/code&gt; shortcut 👍&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have you ever used all debugging functions from this list?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;print&lt;/code&gt; (of course! Who does not?!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;warn&lt;/code&gt; (yes, a customized print)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;croak&lt;/code&gt; (people says it is the magic wand)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;carp&lt;/code&gt; (how is it different from croak?)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;cluck&lt;/code&gt; (WUT?) &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;confess&lt;/code&gt; (how many are there?)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#profiling"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Profiling
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a great and not so great chapter in the same time. There is plenty of profilers listed here like &lt;a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Devel::SmallProf"&gt;Devel::SmallProf&lt;/a&gt; (not updated since 2007, still good?) or &lt;a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/DBI::ProfileDumper"&gt;DBI::ProfileDumper&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Devel::DProf"&gt;Devel::Dprof&lt;/a&gt; (deprecated). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I must add &lt;a href="https://metacpan.org/dist/Devel-NYTProf"&gt;Devel::NYTProf&lt;/a&gt; because it's a must! I think it is not mentioned because it was not created when this book was released.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is even a paragraph to explain how to write your own debugger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's not so great because the first edition of Mastering Perl is old, code is not really modern and it is a bit "too personal" for me (this last point could be a good point for other people, matter of taste).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#benchmark"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Benchmark
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to pure benchmark tips like &lt;code&gt;-DDEBUGGING_MSTATS&lt;/code&gt; compilation flag and benchmark functions like &lt;code&gt;timethese&lt;/code&gt; there are technical details from perl internals (and this is something I really enjoy)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"perl trades memory for processing speed" or "perl does a lot of lookup instead a lot of compilation" or even about memory management (perl takes big memory chunk and tries to reuse them)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some usage of &lt;a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Devel::Peek"&gt;Devel::Peek&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Devel::Size"&gt;Devel::Size&lt;/a&gt; are showing how perl behaves (SV, PV, PVIV, how data is stored) and how we can inspect this even from running program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really loved this chapter!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#clean-up-perl"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Clean Up Perl
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This chapter is about managing a codebase and does not fall into the trap of giving details about coding style but keeps about generic concepts:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"Code isn't bad because a novice Perl programmer can't read it"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"[You should] Be able to understand handful major coding styles"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"Be coherent and mimic existing style"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#typeglobs"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Typeglobs
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Very interesting explanations about scopes (&lt;code&gt;my&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;local&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;our&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;packages&lt;/code&gt;) passing functions as parameters or return values of functions.&lt;br&gt;
It opens the door to the next chapter about "Dynamic Subs"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#dynamic-subroutines"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Dynamic subroutines
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of black magic here about references, symbolic references, &lt;a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Data::Constraint"&gt;Data::Constraint&lt;/a&gt; (that I found pretty clever), Autoload, Autosplit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Code samples are dirty: hacks + &lt;code&gt;goto&lt;/code&gt; + &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;{$AUTOLOAD}&lt;/code&gt; + regex + &lt;code&gt;$1&lt;/code&gt; + &lt;code&gt;$_&lt;/code&gt; + &lt;code&gt;no stricts&lt;/code&gt; + &lt;code&gt;$sub = sub&lt;/code&gt; + &lt;code&gt;die&lt;/code&gt; + &lt;code&gt;$_[0]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But hey it's gory details, at some point if we want to understand all Perl internals...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And as I said it is really black magic! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#modifying-and-jury-rigging-modules"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Modifying and jury rigging modules
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This chapter explains how to debug/patch modules.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the record: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Local patch with very high version&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Redefine sub in caller code&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wrap sub in caller code&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Subclass (if possible) sub in caller code &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#configuring-perl-programs"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Configuring Perl programs
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Various methods described:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Config in Perl code&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Config in external Perl code (e.g. code.pl &lt;code&gt;require&lt;/code&gt; config.pl)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Config in ENV vars&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Command line args (via GetOpt or &lt;code&gt;perl -s&lt;/code&gt;). Raku has MAIN&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Config file (ini, yaml...)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Configure according to filename (modern trick like git-log)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Interactive questions (if interactive shell &lt;code&gt;-t STDOUT&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Heavy config &lt;code&gt;use Config&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#error-reporting-and-logging"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Error reporting and logging
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We don't really have exceptions in Perl, we have &lt;code&gt;eval&lt;/code&gt; + &lt;code&gt;die&lt;/code&gt; to simulate or &lt;code&gt;try&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;catch&lt;/code&gt; coming into core right now but is it not universally used. The chapter details about sending and retrieving errors or propagating them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Logging chapter presents some logging facilities and especially &lt;code&gt;log4perl&lt;/code&gt; which is very powerful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#data-persistence"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Data persistence
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once again this chapter gives you pointers:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;pack&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Data::Dumper"&gt;Data::Dumper&lt;/a&gt; to serialize as string&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;YAML&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Storable"&gt;Storable&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DBM (not always portable if we use different driver)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Concerning serialization, I must add &lt;a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Sereal"&gt;Sereal&lt;/a&gt;, ProtocolBuffer and Avro.&lt;br&gt;
I think none of them existed when the book was released.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EDIT: some more... MessagePack, XDR 😀&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#working-with-bits-and-tied-variables"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Working with bits and tied variables
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Diving into functions "close to material" with &lt;code&gt;vec&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Bit::Vector"&gt;Bit::Vector&lt;/a&gt; an &lt;a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Tie::Cycle"&gt;Tie::Cycle&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Tie::BoundedInteger"&gt;Tie::BoundedInteger&lt;/a&gt; etc...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#modules-as-programs"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Modules as programs
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Very nice trick with &lt;code&gt;caller()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#tricks-in-bulk"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Tricks in bulk
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;@{[ ]}&lt;/code&gt; see &lt;a href="https://metacpan.org/dist/perlsecret/view/lib/perlsecret.pod#Baby-cart"&gt;baby cart&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;using &lt;code&gt;keys map&lt;/code&gt; to untaint&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;WARN&lt;/code&gt; is  signal!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;L::*&lt;/code&gt; (I think it's &lt;a href="https://pause.perl.org/pause/query?ACTION=pause_namingmodules#Local"&gt;like Local::*&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;dualvar&lt;/code&gt; for error for instance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;END blocks are executed after a &lt;code&gt;die&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;$^E&lt;/code&gt; for OS specific errors&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can put perl code in log4perl conf&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Data::Dumper"&gt;Data::Dumper&lt;/a&gt; does not work for subs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;vec&lt;/code&gt; can be a lvalue&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;make disttest&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;make tardist&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#citations"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Citations
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"Humility is the principal virtue of a maintenance programmer"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"Talk to your Perl therapist"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#conclusion"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Conclusion
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While being imperfect (mainly due to the age of the book, &lt;del&gt;only one and last edition in 2007&lt;/del&gt;), &lt;a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/mastering-perl/9780596527242/"&gt;Mastering Perl&lt;/a&gt; is rewarding and teaches a lot of useful things from programming concepts to Perl details (more the latter actually).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can recommend this book since I learned a lot of tricks 😀&lt;/p&gt;

        <![CDATA[<p>I've released version 1.36 of berrybrew, the Perlbrew for Windows. I've also reached out to see how I can become part of the Strawberry Perl team to get back on track with the release of new Strawberry Perls.</p>

<p>If you have any information on the release procedure for Strawberry, or know anyone on that team I might be able to contact to get things moving forward again, please let me know.</p>

<p>This release contains one significant new feature, the ability to use Powershell as the shell when opening or using a Perl. In the UI, when you "Open" your current Perl, or "use" any Perl you have installed, if the "Use Powershell" option is checked, instead of a cmd.exe shell, you'll be presented with a Powershell one instead (same applies for the command line <code>berrybrew use $version</code>.</p>

<p><a href="http://blogs.perl.org/users/steve_bertrand/assets_c/2021/11/berrybrew-ui_use_powershell-4730.html" onclick="window.open('http://blogs.perl.org/users/steve_bertrand/assets_c/2021/11/berrybrew-ui_use_powershell-4730.html','popup','width=1920,height=969,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false"><img src="http://blogs.perl.org/users/steve_bertrand/assets_c/2021/11/berrybrew-ui_use_powershell-thumb-640x323-4730.png" width="640" height="323" alt="berrybrew-ui_use_powershell.png" class="mt-image-none" style="" /></a></p>

<p>The other changes in this release enhance the unit testing infrastructure, and the tests themselves.</p>

<p>Other notable changes since my last blog post:</p>

<ul>
<li>The <code>berrybrew associate</code> command now has an alias of <code>assoc</code> for fewer keystrokes</li>
<li>Better exception handling in several cases</li>
<li>Documentation clarifications</li>
<li>Removed the <code>upgrade</code> command. It's now recommended to use the Installer to manage upgrades</li>
<li>Fix issue when using berrybrew to manage file associations where arguments passed to perl were being handled incorrectly</li>
<li>Unit test infrastructure enhancements</li>
</ul>

    <title>Weekly Challenge 137</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://dev.to/simongreennet/weekly-challenge-137-3jon" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://theweeklychallenge.org/blog/perl-weekly-challenge-137/"&gt;Challenge&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/tree/master/challenge-137/sgreen"&gt;My solutions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So while Mohammad was commiserating the Indians losing to the Black Caps last night, as a Kiwi living in Australia I was a very happy boy. Well done to Kane Williamson and the lads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#task-1-long-year"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  TASK #1 › Long Year
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#task"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Task
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Write a script to find all the years between 1900 and 2100 which is a Long Year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#my-solution"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  My solution
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we switched to the &lt;a href="https://www.timeanddate.com/calendar/julian-gregorian-switch.html"&gt;Gregorian calendar&lt;/a&gt; in 1752, they definitely didn't have computers in their mind. Date math really sucks. If we thought Y2K was serious, I suspect (the non-existent) 29/2/2100 is going to be even worse. We've got to deal with the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year_2038_problem"&gt;2038 date problem&lt;/a&gt; first. But I digress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The terms 'long year' and '53 week years' aren't used at all in New Zealand and Australia, so I had to look up the meaning. According to &lt;a href="https://www.timeanddate.com/date/week-numbers.html"&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt; "if the year starts on a Thursday or is a leap year that starts on a Wednesday, that particular year will have 53 numbered weeks. These week numbers are commonly used in some European and Asian countries; but not so much in the United States."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This seems rather simple exercise after that. We start with the fact that 1/1/1900 was a Monday. I set &lt;code&gt;$year&lt;/code&gt; to 1900 and &lt;code&gt;$day_of_week&lt;/code&gt; to 1 (where 0 = Sunday, 6 = Saturday). If day of week is 4 (Thursday) or 3 (Wednesday) in a leap year, I add it to the &lt;code&gt;@long_years&lt;/code&gt; array.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next fact is the first day of the next year is either one day (or two days for leap years) later than the current year. For example, 1/1/1900 was a Monday, so 1/1/1901 was a Tuesday. Remember 1900 was NOT a leap year. I change &lt;code&gt;$year&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;$day_of_week&lt;/code&gt; as required, and keep running the loop until 2100.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Comparing the output to the example gives the same result, so hopefully it's all good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#examples"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Examples
&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ ./ch-1.pl 
1903, 1908, 1914, 1920, 1925, 1931, 1936, 1942, 1948, 1953, 1959, 1964, 1970, 1976, 1981, 1987, 1992, 1998, 2004, 2009, 2015, 2020, 2026, 2032, 2037, 2043, 2048, 2054, 2060, 2065, 2071, 2076, 2082, 2088, 2093, 2099
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#task-2-lychrel-number"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  TASK #2 › Lychrel Number
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#task"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Task
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You are given a number, 10 ≤ $n ≤ 1000.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Write a script to find out if the given number is &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lychrel_number"&gt;Lychrel number&lt;/a&gt;. To keep the task simple, we impose the following rules:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stop if the number of iterations reached 500.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stop if you end up with number &amp;gt;= 10,000,000.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#my-solution"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  My solution
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I thought date math was hard, number theory blows my mind. The Wikipedia page contains the equation below, which I don't even know where to begin!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--nhZA6HGl--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/7m1ppwjck2yw9gy28p47.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--nhZA6HGl--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/7m1ppwjck2yw9gy28p47.png" alt="Complex equation" width="182" height="60"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So it's the brute force method for me. One great thing about Perl is that distinction between a number and a string that contains a number is almost non-existent. I know in the internals it's different, but from a coding point of view the transition between the two is seamless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I check if the input is palindromic by comparing using the reverse function (which reverses the string in a scalar context). If it isn't I add the two numbers together and repeat the process until it is a match or we have reached the rules above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#example"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Example
&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ ./ch-2.pl 56
0

$ ./ch-2.pl 57
0

$ ./ch-2.pl 59
0

$ ./ch-2.pl 788
1
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>#536 - Auf Wiedersehen Hacktoberfest</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://perlweekly.com/archive/536.html" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Hi there</p>
<p>The headline of this week's newsletter is dedicated to all my German friends. However, the message is global "Good bye Hacktoberfest". I don't know the language, so I asked Google to help me. I am sure you all celebrated the month-long festival with loads of contributions to many opensource codebases. I can completely understand the feeling at the end of the month. Those who have participated and completed the challenge successfully i.e. submitted at least 4 eligible Pull Requests, should just relax and wait for their FREE gift. Please take November as a break as December will bring in another fun challenge i.e. <a href="https://24pullrequests.com">24 Pull Requests</a> for you.</p>
<p>Anything else to look forward to?</p>
<p>For me, there is another fun bit is the "Advent Calendar". There will be plenty of Advent Calendars available during the month. It is really hard to follow all of them. I came across something called, <a href="http://www.lenjaffe.com/AdventPlanet">Advent Planet</a>, which collects almost all popular Advent Calendars for us. Please do check it out, if you want a early peek. I really miss those days when I used to have time for such things. I have contributed to the Perl/Raku advent calendars in the past. If you have spare time and interest then please do get in touch with the person behind the project now and book your slot. There is one <a href="https://theweeklychallenge.org/blog/advent-calendar-2020">Advent Calendar</a> dedicated to the members of <a href="https://theweeklychallenge.org">The Weekly Challenge</a> only. I make sure the tradition continues every year. I hope everything goes as per the plan and we have another fun Advent Calendar by the dedicated members this year.</p>
<p>Start your week with yet another informative newsletter. You take care of yourself and your family. Keep a safe distance and stay safe,</p></div>

    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The examples used here are from The Weekly Challenge problem statement and demonstrate 
the working solution.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Part 1&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You are given 2 positive numbers, $m and $n. Write a script to find out if the given two 
numbers are Two Friendly.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Solution&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="perl"&gt;
use strict;
use warnings;
use POSIX;
use boolean;

sub euclid {
    my($a, $b) = @_;
    return ($b) ? euclid($b, $a % $b) : $a;
}

sub two_friendly{
    my($m, $n) = @_;
    my $gcd = euclid($m, $n);
    my $p = log($gcd) / log(2);
    return boolean(ceil($p) == floor($p));
}

MAIN:{
    print two_friendly(8, 24). "\n";
    print two_friendly(26, 39). "\n";
    print two_friendly(4, 10). "\n";
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Sample Run&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="shell"&gt;
$ perl perl/ch-1.pl
1
0
1
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Notes&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've used this code for Euclid's GCD method before in 
&lt;a href="http://www.rabbitfarm.com/cgi-bin/blosxom/2020/12/06#pwc089"&gt;Challenge 089&lt;/a&gt;. To determine
if &lt;code&gt;$p&lt;/code&gt; is an integer we check to see if the &lt;code&gt;floor()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;ceiling()&lt;/code&gt; are equal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Part 2&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You are given a positive number $n. Write a script to find how many different sequences 
you can create using Fibonacci numbers where the sum of unique numbers in each sequence 
are the same as the given number.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Solution&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="perl"&gt;
use strict;
use warnings;
use Data::PowerSet q/powerset/;

sub fibonacci_below_n{
    my($n, $fibonaccis) = @_;
    $fibonaccis = [1, 1] if !$fibonaccis;
    my $f = $fibonaccis-&gt;[@{$fibonaccis} - 2] + $fibonaccis-&gt;[@{$fibonaccis} - 1];
    if($f &lt; $n){
        push @{$fibonaccis}, $f;
        fibonacci_below_n($n, $fibonaccis);
    }
    else{
        shift @{$fibonaccis};
        return $fibonaccis;
    }
}

sub fibonacci_sum{
    my($n) = @_;
    my $powerset = powerset(fibonacci_below_n($n));
    my @summands = grep {
        my $fibonaccis = $_;
        my $sum = 0;
        map{
            $sum += $_;
        } @{$fibonaccis};
        $sum == $n;
    } @{$powerset};
    return @summands;
}

MAIN:{
    for my $summands (fibonacci_sum($ARGV[0])){
        print "(" . join(" + ", @{$summands}) . ") = " . $ARGV[0] . "\n";
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Sample Run&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="shell"&gt;
$ perl perl/ch-2.pl 16
(3 + 13) = 16
(1 + 2 + 13) = 16
(3 + 5 + 8) = 16
(1 + 2 + 5 + 8) = 16
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Notes&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of using a pre-computed list of Fibonacci numbers we generate them as needed. No
particular reason other than it's a little more fun, and also it allows us to flexibly 
allow for virtually any value for &lt;code&gt;$n&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sequences are determined by examining the Power Set of all possible sequences and
checking the sums.&lt;/p&gt;

        <![CDATA[<p>These are some answers to the Week 136 of the <a href="https://perlweeklychallenge.org/blog/perl-weekly-challenge-136/">Perl Weekly Challenge</a> organized by <a href="http://blogs.perl.org/users/mohammad_s_anwar/">Mohammad S. Anwar</a>.</p>

<p><em>Spoiler Alert:</em> This weekly challenge deadline is due in a few days from now (on October 31, 2021 at 24:00). This blog post offers some solutions to this challenge, please don’t read on if you intend to complete the challenge on your own.</p>

<h2>Task 1: Two Friendly</h2>

<p><em>You are given 2 positive numbers, <code>$m</code> and <code>$n</code>.</em></p>

<p><em>Write a script to find out if the given two numbers are Two Friendly.</em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Two positive numbers, m and n are two friendly when gcd(m, n) = 2 ^ p where p > 0. The greatest common divisor (gcd) of a set of numbers is the largest positive number that divides all the numbers in the set without remainder.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Example 1:</em></p>

<pre><code>Input: $m = 8, $n = 24
Output: 1

Reason: gcd(8,24) = 8 =&gt; 2 ^ 3
</code></pre>

<p><em>Example 2:</em></p>

<pre><code>Input: $m = 26, $n = 39
Output: 0

Reason: gcd(26,39) = 13
</code></pre>

<p><em>Example 3:</em></p>

<pre><code>Input: $m = 4, $n = 10
Output: 1

Reason: gcd(4,10) = 2 =&gt; 2 ^ 1
</code></pre>

<p>In other words, the greatest common divisor of two friendly numbers needs to be a power of two. Or, there must be a power of two for which, when both integers are divided by this power of two, the results are co-primes.</p>

<h3>Two Friendly Numbers in Raku</h3>

<p>Raku has a built-in <a href="https://docs.raku.org/routine/gcd">gcd</a> infix operator. So we just need to compute the GCD if the two input integers. If the GCD is 1 (numbers are co-primes) or less (one of the input integers was 0), then we return 0, as the integers are not two friendly numbers. (Note that it may be argued that 1 is a power of 2, i.e. 2 ^ 0, but I considered this to be a degenerate case, and that co-primes are not two-friendly; anyway, the task description is clear on the subject and specifies that &#8220;gcd(m, n) = 2 ^ p <em>where p > 0</em>&#8221;).  Otherwise, we divide the GCD by two as long as the result is even. When we can no longer divide by two, the two input integers were two friendly numbers if the result of the final division is 1 (as the GCD was a power of two).</p>

<pre><code>use v6;

sub is-friendly (Int $i, Int $j) {
    my $gcd = $i gcd $j;
    return 0 if $gcd &lt;= 1;
    $gcd /= 2 while $gcd %% 2;
    return $gcd == 1 ?? 1 !! 0;
}
for 8, 24, 26, 39, 4, 10, 7, 5, 18, 0 {
    say "$^a, $^b =&gt; ", is-friendly $^a, $^b;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Note that Raku can take two numbers at a time from the input list in the <code>for</code> loop at the bottom, because the loop uses two parameters, which is quite convenient. In this case, we used <a href="https://docs.raku.org/language/variables#The_^_twigil">placeholder variables aka self-declared positional parameters</a> (<code>$^a</code> and <code>$^b</code>), but it would also work just as well with formal declared loop parameters, such as:</p>

<pre><code>for 8, 24, 26, 39, 4, 10, 7, 5, 18, 0 -&gt; $a, $b {
    say "$a, $b =&gt; ", is-friendly $a, $b;
}
</code></pre>

<p>This program yields the following results for the built-in input test integers:</p>

<pre><code>$ raku ./friendly.raku
8, 24 =&gt; 1
26, 39 =&gt; 0
4, 10 =&gt; 1
7, 5 =&gt; 0
18, 0 =&gt; 0
</code></pre>

<h3>Two Friendly Numbers in Perl</h3>

<p>Just like in Raku, we divide the GCD by two as long as the result is even. When we can no longer divide by two, the two input integers were two friendly numbers is the result of the final division is 1. The main difference with Raku, though, is that Perl doesn&#8217;t have a built-in GCD function or operator. So we implement the <code>gcd</code> subroutine for that purpose, implementing a well-known method derived from the famous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_algorithm">Euclidean algorithm</a>.</p>

<pre><code>use strict;
use warnings;
use feature "say";

sub gcd {
    my ($i, $j) = @_;
    return 0 if $i &lt; 1 or $j &lt; 1;
    while ($j) {
        ($i, $j) = ($j, $i % $j);
    }
    return $i;
}
sub is_friendly {
    my $gcd = gcd $_[0], $_[1];
    return 0 if $gcd &lt;= 1;
    $gcd /= 2 while $gcd % 2 == 0;
    return $gcd == 1 ? 1 : 0;
}
for my $pair ([8, 24], [26, 39], [4, 10], [7, 5], [18, 0]) {
    say "@$pair =&gt; ", is_friendly @$pair;
}
</code></pre>

<p>This program displays the following output:</p>

<pre><code>$ perl ./friendly.pl
8 24 =&gt; 1
26 39 =&gt; 0
4 10 =&gt; 1
7 5 =&gt; 0
18 0 =&gt; 0
</code></pre>

<h2>Task 2: Fibonacci Sequence</h2>

<p><em>You are given a positive number <code>$n</code>.</em></p>

<p><em>Write a script to find how many different sequences you can create using Fibonacci numbers where the sum of unique numbers in each sequence are the same as the given number.</em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Fibonacci Numbers: 1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55,89, …</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Example 1:</em></p>

<pre><code>Input:  $n = 16
Output: 4

Reason: There are 4 possible sequences that can be created using Fibonacci numbers
i.e. (3 + 13), (1 + 2 + 13), (3 + 5 + 8) and (1 + 2 + 5 + 8).
</code></pre>

<p><em>Example 2:</em></p>

<pre><code>Input:  $n = 9
Output: 2

Reason: There are 2 possible sequences that can be created using Fibonacci numbers
i.e. (1 + 3 + 5) and (1 + 8).
</code></pre>

<p><em>Example 3:</em></p>

<pre><code>Input:  $n = 15
Output: 2

Reason: There are 2 possible sequences that can be created using Fibonacci numbers
i.e. (2 + 5 + 8) and (2 + 13).
</code></pre>

<h3>Fibonacci Sequence in Raku</h3>

<p>I do not see any way to solve this problem other than listing all possible sequences of Fibonacci numbers less than or equal to the target number and counting those sequence whose sum is equal to the target number. We first initialize a list (a global variable) of the first 16 Fibonacci numbers using the <a href="https://docs.raku.org/language/operators#index-entry-sequence_operator">sequence <code>...</code> operator</a>. The reason for doing this is that we don&#8217;t want to recompute the Fibonacci numbers for every input test integer. Of course, we would have to change this for input integers larger than 1597, but that&#8217;s good enough for our testing purpose.</p>

<p>Then, the <code>fib-seq</code> subroutine uses the built-in <a href="https://docs.raku.org/routine/combinations">combinations</a> method to generate all sequences of Fibonacci numbers and uses the builin <code>grep</code> and <code>sum</code> functions to keep the sequences whose sum is equal to the target input integer. And it returns the number of sequences matching this criterion.</p>

<p>Note that, although the task specification did not request that, I&#8217;ve decided to print out the matching sequences as this makes it much easier to check the result.</p>

<pre><code>use v6;

my @fib = 1, 2, * + * ... * &gt; 1000; # 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55 89 144 233 377 610 987 1597

sub fib-seq (UInt $n) {
    my $count = 0;
    ++$count and .say for grep { $_.sum == $n }, @fib.grep({$_ &lt;= $n }).combinations;
    return $count;
}
for 16, 9, 15, 89, 100 {
    say "Number of sequences for $_: ", fib-seq($_), "\n";
}
</code></pre>

<p>This programs prints out the following output:</p>

<pre><code>$ raku ./main.raku
(3 13)
(1 2 13)
(3 5 8)
(1 2 5 8)
Number of sequences for 16: 4

(1 8)

(3 8 34 55)
(1 2 3 5 89)
(1 2 8 34 55)
(3 8 13 21 55)
(1 2 3 5 34 55)
(1 2 8 13 21 55)
(1 2 3 5 13 21 55)
Number of sequences for 100: 9
</code></pre>

<h3>Fibonacci Sequence in Perl</h3>

<p>The Perl implementation is very similar to the Raku implementation, except that we need to code our own <code>sum</code> and <code>combine</code> subroutines to replace the equivalent Raku built-in methods.</p>

<p>Note that, as in Raku and although the task specification did not request that, I&#8217;ve decided to print out the matching sequences as this makes it much easier to check the result. Just comment out the penultimate code line of the <code>fib_seq</code> subroutine to avoid printing the sequences.</p>

<pre><code>use strict;
use warnings;
use feature "say";
use Data::Dumper;

my @comb;
my @fib = qw /1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55 89 144 233 377 610 987 1597/;

sub sum {
    my $sum = 0;
    $sum += $_ for @_;
    return $sum;
}

sub combine {
    my $target = shift;
    my $count = shift;
    my @out = @{$_[0]};
    my @in  = @{$_[1]};
    return if sum @out &gt; $target;
    push @comb, [@out] and return if sum(@out) == $target;
    return if $count == 0;
    for my $i (0..$#in) {
        combine ($target, $count - 1, [@out, $in[$i]], [@in[$i+1..$#in]]);
    }
}


sub fib_seq {
    my $n = shift;
    my @short_fib = grep { $_ &lt;= $n } @fib;
    my $count =  scalar @short_fib;
    @comb = ();
    combine $n, $count, [], [@short_fib];
    say "@$_" for @comb;
    return scalar @comb;
}

say "Number of sequences for $_: ", fib_seq $_ for 16, 9, 15, 89, 100;
</code></pre>

<p>This program displays the following output:</p>

<pre><code>$ perl ./fib-seq.pl

  TASK #1 › Two Friendly
</h2>

<h3>
  <a href="#task">
  </a>
  Task
</h3>

<p>You are given 2 positive numbers, <code>$m</code> and <code>$n</code>.</p>

<p>Write a script to find out if the given two numbers are Two Friendly.</p>

<p>Two positive numbers, m and n are two friendly when gcd(m, n) = 2<sup>p</sup> where p &gt; 0. The greatest common divisor (gcd) of a set of numbers is the largest positive number that divides all the numbers in the set without remainder.</p>

<h3>
  <a href="#my-solution">
  </a>
  My solution
</h3>

<p>Pretty straight forward task to start with. It really is broken down to two parts. Both of them are rather crude methods of finding a solution. Given that we are dealing with small numbers, this really isn't a major issue.</p>

<ol>
<li>Calculate the G.C.D. For this I start the lower value of the two inputs, and count down by one until we find a number that divides both inputs with no remainder.</li>
<li>Calculate whether the GCD is a power of two. For this I set the variable <code>$i</code> to count from 1. If 2<sup>$i</sup> is the GCD, we return 1. If it is larger than the GCD, we return zero. Otherwise we add one to <code>$i</code> and check again.</li>
</ol>

<p>Now that I think about it (a few days after I wrote this code), a better solution would be to divide both numbers by 2 until their is an odd number. With these two numbers, if any of them are divisible by any other number (between 3 and the smallest), then we know that the combination is not a number of two.</p>

  TASK #2 › Fibonacci Sequence

<h3>
  <a href="#task">
  </a>
  Task
</h3>

<p>You are given a positive number <code>$n</code>.</p>

<p>Write a script to find how many different sequences you can create using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number">Fibonacci numbers</a> where the sum of unique numbers in each sequence are the same as the given number.</p>

<h3>
  <a href="#my-solution">
  </a>
  My solution
</h3>

<p>I start by generating a list of Fibonacci numbers between one and the input. Although the sequence actually starts with (0, 1), I take a short cut and start with (1, 2).</p>

<p>Like with the above task, there are probably two ways to solve this (although some bright sparks might have an even better solution). The first method is to use a binary switch to compute all possible solutions. This works well when there is a small number of solutions, the possible solutions is 2<sup>n</sup> where n is the number of Fibonacci numbers.</p>

<p>In the end I decided to use a recursive function <code>_find_sums</code>. It takes two inputs, the remaining target and the remaining numbers. For each iteration I pop off the largest number. If that number or all remaining numbers match the target then we count this as a solution. If the remaining numbers is larger than the remaining target, we call the function again. If it is less, no solution is possible.</p>

<p>Finally I display the result.</p>

        <![CDATA[<p>Sooner or later any programmer, writing in any language, will run across something like this Perl warning: <code>Subroutine foo redefined</code>. This is telling you that somehow, somewhere, you tried to create two subroutines with the same name.</p>

<p>Tracking this down can be tricky, and remediation equally so. The possibilities include:</p>

<ul>
    <li>If one of your own subroutines is involved, you can rename it.</li>
    <li>If an imported subroutine that you do not need is involved, you can just not import it. This, of course, involves figuring out which imports you <strong>do</strong> need. The use of default import lists can make tracking this one down tricky.</li>
    <li>You can use <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Importer">Importer</a> to import a subroutine under a different name.</li>
    <li>You can ignore the import mechanism and populate the symbol table yourself with something like <code>BEGIN { require Some::Module; *foo = \&amp;Some::Module::bar; }</code>, after which <code>bar()</code> calls <code>Some::Module::foo()</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>But maybe you really want to replace a subroutine, in which case you do not want the warning. For example you might want to tweak the action of a subroutine with a hot patch. A trivial example looks something like this:</p>

<pre>
{
    no warnings qw{ redefine };
    my $old_foo = \&amp;foo;
    *foo = sub {
        warn "Debug - Called foo( qw{ @_ } )";
	goto $old_foo;
    };
}
</pre>

<p>This disables the <a href="https://perldoc.perl.org/perldiag#Subroutine--s-redefined">redefine</a> warning. saves the code reference to <code>foo()</code> and replaces it with code that logs the arguments (sort of) and then transfers control to the original <code>foo()</code>. The block is to restrict the scope of the <code>no warnings</code> pragma, but it could equally be a <code>BEGIN</code> block if your use case requires it.</p>

    <title>Better Perl: Four list processing best practices with map, grep, and more</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://dev.to/mjgardner/better-perl-four-list-processing-best-practices-with-map-grep-and-more-ino" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Six months ago I gave &lt;a href="https://phoenixtrap.com/2021/03/16/perl_map_grep/"&gt;an overview of Perl’s list processing fundamentals&lt;/a&gt;, briefly describing what lists are and then introducing the built-in &lt;a href="https://perldoc.perl.org/functions/map"&gt;&lt;code&gt;map&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://perldoc.perl.org/functions/grep"&gt;&lt;code&gt;grep&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; functions for transforming and filtering them. Later on, I compiled a list (how appropriate) of &lt;a href="https://phoenixtrap.com/2021/05/18/a-list-of-perl-list-processing-modules/"&gt;list processing modules available via CPAN&lt;/a&gt;, noting there’s some confusing duplication of effort. But you’re a busy developer, and you just want to know the Right Thing To Do™️ when faced with a list processing challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, some credit is due: these are all restatements of several &lt;a href="https://metacpan.org/dist/Perl-Critic/view/lib/Perl/Critic/PolicySummary.pod"&gt;Perl::Critic policies&lt;/a&gt; which in turn codify standards described in &lt;a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/perl-best-practices/0596001738/"&gt;Damian Conway’s &lt;em&gt;Perl Best Practices&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (2005). I’ve &lt;a href="https://phoenixtrap.com/tag/pbp/"&gt;repeatedly recommended&lt;/a&gt; the latter as a starting point for higher-quality Perl development. Over the years these practices continue to be re-evaluated (including &lt;a href="https://www.oreilly.com/videos/modern-perl-best/9781491910719/"&gt;by the author himself&lt;/a&gt;) and various authors release new &lt;a href="https://metacpan.org/search?q=module%3APerl%3A%3ACritic%3A%3APolicy"&gt;policy modules&lt;/a&gt;, but &lt;a href="https://metacpan.org/dist/Perl-Critic/view/bin/perlcritic"&gt;&lt;code&gt;perlcritic&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; remains a great tool for ensuring you (and your team or other contributors) maintain a consistent high standard in your code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With that said, on to the recommendations!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#dont-use-raw-grep-endraw-to-check-if-any-list-elements-match"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Don’t use &lt;code&gt;grep&lt;/code&gt; to check if &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; list elements match
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It might sound weird to lead off by recommending &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; to use &lt;code&gt;grep&lt;/code&gt;, but sometimes it’s not the right tool for the job. If you’ve got a list and want to determine if a condition matches any item in it, you might try:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight perl"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;grep&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;some_condition&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="vg"&gt;$_&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;@my_list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="o"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# don't do this!&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yes, this works because (in scalar &lt;a href="https://perldoc.perl.org/perldata#Context"&gt;context&lt;/a&gt;) &lt;code&gt;grep&lt;/code&gt; returns the number of matches found, but it’s wasteful, checking every element of &lt;code&gt;@my_list&lt;/code&gt; (which could be lengthy) before finally providing a result. Use the standard &lt;a href="https://perldoc.perl.org/List::Util"&gt;List::Util&lt;/a&gt; module’s &lt;a href="https://perldoc.perl.org/List::Util#any"&gt;&lt;code&gt;any&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; function, which immediately returns (“short-circuits”) on the first match:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight perl"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;use&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;List::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;Util&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mf"&gt;1.33&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="sx"&gt;qw(any)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;any&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;some_condition&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="vg"&gt;$_&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;@my_list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="o"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# do something&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Perl has included the requisite version of this module &lt;a href="https://perldoc.perl.org/perl5200delta#Updated-Modules-and-Pragmata"&gt;since version 5.20&lt;/a&gt; in 2014; for earlier releases, you’ll need to &lt;a href="https://metacpan.org/dist/Scalar-List-Utils"&gt;update from CPAN&lt;/a&gt;. List::Util has many other great &lt;a href="https://perldoc.perl.org/List::Util#LIST-REDUCTION-FUNCTIONS"&gt;list-reduction&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://perldoc.perl.org/List::Util#KEY/VALUE-PAIR-LIST-FUNCTIONS"&gt;key/value pair&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://perldoc.perl.org/List::Util#OTHER-FUNCTIONS"&gt;other related functions&lt;/a&gt; you can import into your code, so check it out before you attempt to re-invent any wheels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a side note for web developers, the &lt;a href="https://www.perldancer.org/"&gt;Perl Dancer framework&lt;/a&gt; also includes an &lt;a href="https://metacpan.org/dist/Dancer2/view/lib/Dancer2/Manual/Keywords.pod#any"&gt;&lt;code&gt;any&lt;/code&gt; keyword&lt;/a&gt; for declaring multiple HTTP routes, so if you’re mixing List::Util in there don’t import it. Instead, call it explicitly like this or you’ll get an error about a redefined function:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight perl"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;use&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;List::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;Util&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mf"&gt;1.33&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nn"&gt;List::Util::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;any&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;some_condition&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="vg"&gt;$_&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;@my_list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="o"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# do something&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This recommendation is codified in the &lt;a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Perl::Critic::Policy::BuiltinFunctions::ProhibitBooleanGrep"&gt;BuiltinFunctions::ProhibitBooleanGrep&lt;/a&gt; Perl::Critic policy, comes directly from &lt;em&gt;Perl Best Practices&lt;/em&gt;, and is &lt;a href="https://wiki.sei.cmu.edu/confluence/display/perl/EXP06-PL.+Do+not+use+an+array+in+an+implicit+scalar+context"&gt;recommended&lt;/a&gt; by the Software Engineering Institute Computer Emergency Response Team (SEI CERT)’s &lt;a href="https://wiki.sei.cmu.edu/confluence/display/perl/SEI+CERT+Perl+Coding+Standard"&gt;Perl Coding Standard&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#dont-change-raw-endraw-in-raw-map-endraw-or-raw-grep-endraw-"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Don’t change &lt;code&gt;$_&lt;/code&gt; in &lt;code&gt;map&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;grep&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I &lt;a href="https://phoenixtrap.com/2021/03/16/perl_map_grep/#side_effects"&gt;mentioned this back in March&lt;/a&gt;, but it bears repeating: &lt;code&gt;map&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;grep&lt;/code&gt; are intended as &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_function"&gt;pure functions&lt;/a&gt;, not &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutator_method"&gt;mutators&lt;/a&gt; with side effects. This means that the original list should remain unchanged. Yes, each element aliases in turn to the &lt;a href="https://perldoc.perl.org/variables/%24_"&gt;&lt;code&gt;$_&lt;/code&gt; special variable&lt;/a&gt;, but that’s for speed and can have surprising results if changed even if it’s technically allowed. If you need to modify an array in-place use something like:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight perl"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;@my_array&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="vg"&gt;$_&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# make your changes here&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you want something that &lt;em&gt;looks&lt;/em&gt; like &lt;code&gt;map&lt;/code&gt; but won’t change the original list (and don’t mind a few CPAN dependencies), consider &lt;a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/List::SomeUtils"&gt;List::SomeUtils&lt;/a&gt;’ &lt;a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/List::MoreUtils#apply-BLOCK-LIST"&gt;&lt;code&gt;apply&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; function:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight perl"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;use&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;List::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;SomeUtils&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="sx"&gt;qw(apply)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;my&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;@doubled_array&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;apply&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="vg"&gt;$_&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;@old_array&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Lastly, side effects also include things like manipulating other variables or doing input and output. Don’t use &lt;code&gt;map&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;grep&lt;/code&gt; in a void context (i.e., without a resulting array or list); do something with the results or use a &lt;a href="https://perldoc.perl.org/perlsyn#Foreach-Loops"&gt;&lt;code&gt;for&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;foreach&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; loop:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight perl"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;map&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;foo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="vg"&gt;$_&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;@my_array&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# don't do this&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;map&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;foo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="vg"&gt;$_&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;@my_array&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# do this instead&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nb"&gt;map&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;push&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;@new_array&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;foo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="vg"&gt;$_&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;@my_array&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# don't do this&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nv"&gt;@new_array&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;map&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;foo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="vg"&gt;$_&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;@my_array&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# do this instead&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This recommendation is codified by the &lt;a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Perl::Critic::Policy::BuiltinFunctions::ProhibitVoidGrep"&gt;BuiltinFunctions::ProhibitVoidGrep&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Perl::Critic::Policy::BuiltinFunctions::ProhibitVoidMap"&gt;BuiltinFunctions::ProhibitVoidMap&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Perl::Critic::Policy::ControlStructures::ProhibitMutatingListFunctions"&gt;ControlStructures::ProhibitMutatingListFunctions&lt;/a&gt; Perl::Critic policies. The latter comes from &lt;em&gt;Perl Best Practices&lt;/em&gt; and is an SEI CERT Perl Coding Standard &lt;a href="https://wiki.sei.cmu.edu/confluence/display/perl/EXP34-PL.+Do+not+modify+%24_+in+list+or+sorting+functions"&gt;rule&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#use-blocks-with-raw-map-endraw-and-raw-grep-endraw-not-expressions"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Use blocks with &lt;code&gt;map&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;grep&lt;/code&gt;, not expressions
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can call &lt;code&gt;map&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;grep&lt;/code&gt; like this (&lt;a href="https://perldoc.perl.org/perlfunc#DESCRIPTION"&gt;parentheses are optional&lt;/a&gt; around built-in functions):&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight perl"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;my&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;@new_array&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;map&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;foo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="vg"&gt;$_&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;@old_array&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# don't do this&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;my&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;@new_array2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;grep&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/^#/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;@old_array&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# don't do this&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Or like this:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Do it the second way. It’s easier to read, especially if you’re passing in a literal list or multiple arrays, and the expression forms can conceal bugs. This recommendation is codified by the &lt;a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Perl::Critic::Policy::BuiltinFunctions::RequireBlockGrep"&gt;BuiltinFunctions::RequireBlockGrep&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Perl::Critic::Policy::BuiltinFunctions::RequireBlockMap"&gt;BuiltinFunctions::RequireBlockMap&lt;/a&gt; Perl::Critic policies and comes from &lt;em&gt;Perl Best Practices&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#refactor-multistatement-raw-map-endraw-s-raw-grep-endraw-s-and-other-list-functions"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Refactor multi-statement &lt;code&gt;map&lt;/code&gt;s, &lt;code&gt;grep&lt;/code&gt;s, and other list functions
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;map&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;grep&lt;/code&gt;, and friends should follow the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy#Do_One_Thing_and_Do_It_Well"&gt;Unix philosophy of “Do One Thing and Do It Well.”&lt;/a&gt; Your readability and maintainability drop with every statement you place inside one of their blocks. Consider junior developers and future maintainers (this includes you!) and refactor anything with more than one statement into a separate subroutine or at least a &lt;code&gt;for&lt;/code&gt; loop. This goes for list processing functions (like the aforementioned &lt;code&gt;any&lt;/code&gt;) imported from other modules, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This recommendation is codified by the &lt;em&gt;Perl Best Practices&lt;/em&gt;-inspired &lt;a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Perl::Critic::Policy::BuiltinFunctions::ProhibitComplexMappings"&gt;BuiltinFunctions::ProhibitComplexMappings&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Perl::Critic::Policy::BuiltinFunctions::RequireSimpleSortBlock"&gt;BuiltinFunctions::RequireSimpleSortBlock&lt;/a&gt; Perl::Critic policies, although those only cover &lt;code&gt;map&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;sort&lt;/code&gt; functions, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Do you have any other suggestions for list processing best practices? Feel free to leave them in the comments or better yet, consider &lt;a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Perl::Critic#EXTENDING-THE-CRITIC"&gt;creating new Perl::Critic policies&lt;/a&gt; for them or &lt;a href="//mailto:team@perlcritic.com"&gt;contacting the Perl::Critic team&lt;/a&gt; to develop them for your organization.&lt;/p&gt;

     <p>(from Jonathan Worthington)</p>

<p>During September, I completed the remaining hours on <a href="https://news.perlfoundation.org/post/grant_proposal_raku_dispatch_compiler_improvements">my current grant</a>.
The key aim of the grant - to bring my work on a new generalized dispatch mechanism to the point where it
could be merged and delivered to Raku users - has been achieved, the merge taking place on 29th September.
I wrote a <a href="https://6guts.wordpress.com/2021/09/29/the-new-moarvm-dispatch-mechanism-is-here/">blog post</a>
that provides some data on the improvements, as well as identifying future work that can build upon what
has been achieved thus far.</p>

<p>During September, working under the grant, I:</p>

<ul>
<li>Implemented specialization and inlining of dispatches that store resume initialization state, to allow
the dispatches to be resumed (for example, if <code>callsame</code> is used). This was a critical part of getting
back the level of inlining for method calls and multi dispatches that existed prior to this work, which
is a critical factor in Raku performance.</li>
<li>Implemented caller-side removal of <code>Scalar</code> containers, which in turn avoids various duplicate guards,
leading to much tighter code being produced after specialization and JIT compilation in many common
situations.</li>
<li>Fixed <code>Junction</code> multi-dispatch failover for the case where the <code>Junction</code> was in a named argument,
along the way tweaking the semantics to be more consistent with those of positional arguments (there
were some unintended discrepancies in the previous implementation).</li>
<li>Changed dispatch program compilation to not emit type guards when the types were already proven during
optimization, rather than adding them and relying on them to be optimized out later.</li>
<li>Reinstated all known missing optimizations from prior to the new dispatch work, and added JIT support
for various new operations introduced during the work.</li>
<li>Did various modifications to improve startup time, which has regressed. The new dispatch model has
many advantages, however does carry a higher warmup cost.</li>
<li>Fixed the profiler to work again in programs that use continuations, after changes to the continuation
representation as part of callstack changes.</li>
<li>Did numerous smaller fixes for bugs identified by <code>blin</code> (which runs the tests of all modules in the
ecosystem). In some cases where the modules relied on internals or unspecified behavior, I sent a PR
to the module instead.</li>
</ul>

<p>The time worked during September was 55 hours and 18 minutes, which was the remaining grant time
available.</p>

     <h2>Project title</h2>

<p>Optimizations building upon the new Raku dispatch mechanism</p>

<h2>Author</h2>

<p>Jonathan Worthington</p>

<h2>Synopsis</h2>

<p>Recently a new dispatch mechanism was merged into MoarVM, along with changes to
Rakudo to make use of it. This led to a number of <a href="https://6guts.wordpress.com/2021/09/29/the-new-moarvm-dispatch-mechanism-is-here/">performance improvements</a>
in the immediate, and incidentally fixed various long-standing bugs. This
is, however, just the start of what can be achieved with the new dispatch
architecture and the changes made to the runtime as part of implementing it.
This grant application requests funding to help deliver further improvements
unlocked by that work.</p>

<h2>How will your work specifically benefit the development of Raku?</h2>

<p>Raku performance has improved significantly since the initial release of the
language. This is thanks to a multi-faceted effort by many Raku contributors,
including putting more powerful optimizations in the runtime, the careful
optimization of the standard library, and developing better tooling for
analyzing performance. However, there is most certainly more to be done in
order that performance becomes a limiting factor for an ever smaller number
of developers considering using Raku.</p>

<p>This work will deliver further performance improvements for many Raku scripts
and applications. It is quite varied in nature, although primarily focuses on
improvements at the level of the language runtime (MoarVM), especially given
the fact that the current compiler frontend will ultimately be replaced thanks
to the ongoing RakuAST effort. Given I am also working on that, I'm well-placed
to avoid doing throwaway work.</p>

<h2>Project Details</h2>

<p>As with previous grants, I request an hourly rate, and propose a set of key
areas that I intend to work on, on the understanding that there may not be
time to complete all of them, or that studying profiler and compilation output
might reveal some more profitable improvements to work on (bigger performance
gains for less effort).</p>

<p>One key area of work is to reduce the cost of calls, which is relatively high.
A lot of this cost is hidden by MoarVM being able to inline (including multiple
levels deep) and, in the case a speculative optimization proves invalid, to
uninline. However, in anything except the tightest microbenchmark, we can't
just inline everything, and the calling cost thus needs to be reduced also. Of
note, I propose to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Reduce the cost of callframe setup by allocating space for registers and,
where possible, the lexical environment directly on the callstack rather
than as separate allocations. This should make every non-inlined call
faster.</li>
<li>Reorganize callframe entry to avoid repeated checks (for example, around
specialized/unspecialized, JIT compiled or not, etc.), perhaps getting rid
of many of the checks entirely in specialized code by compiling the steps
needed for callframe setup.</li>
<li>Find a different, and cheaper, way to handle <code>LEAVE</code> and similar phasers.
These are often required for reliable release of locks, but suffer from
relatively poor performance. Their potential presence also imposes a small
cost even on frames that do not rely upon them, which would be good to
eliminate.</li>
<li>Further rework callframe exit in order to make it cheaper. Of note, MoarVM
has a "special return" mechanism that is used internally to avoid nested
runloops in favor of a Continuation Passing Style approach, which currently
also imposes a small cost on every frame exit (checking if it is needed).
The callstack layout after the new dispatch mechanism work will allow
us to avoid this.</li>
</ul>

<p>Prior to working on the new dispatch mechanism, I started some work on partial
escape analysis, an analysis that allows for eliminating or delaying object
allocations. Raku makes heavy use of objects, which not only imposes the
direct cost of their allocation and later garbage collection, but also the
indirect cost of having further optimizations frustrated by not being able to
look "inside" the object. Some basic escape analysis has already been merged,
while further work was not completed, and in part blocked by things that have
now been resolved. I would like to return to this work, bringing it piecemeal
into the main branch. Of note, this will deliver:</p>

<ul>
<li>Support for transitive escape analysis, so we can avoid the allocation of
entire object graphs (for example, a Scalar container holding a Complex
could potentially elide both allocations).</li>
<li>Restructuring object creation. Today we often lazily allocate containers
for attributes, in part because we depend on it to know whether to apply
attribute default values. This creates complications for escape analysis,
as well as forcing initialization checks in quite a number of places.</li>
<li>Delayed materialization of allocations. For example, if an object is read
and written many times before it escapes (that is, returned or stored
somewhere we can't reason about), we can delay the allocation of the object,
treating its attributes as local variables up to that point. In some cases
the allocation may only happen in one branch (for example, in an exceptional
path), and so be possible to eliminate entirely in the common case.</li>
<li>Handling of <code>Int</code>s in scalar replacement (the process by which non-escaping
object's attributes are stored in VM registers). <code>Int</code> is important given how
common integer math is, but also challenging because of the potential big
integer upgrade. Special care will be needed to never leak memory that is
allocated for a big integer, even in the situations an enclosing object's
allocation is elided.</li>
</ul>

<p>Another area of work is to further improve or make further use of the new
dispatch mechanism. Of note:</p>

<ul>
<li>Apply the same caller-side decontainerization of <code>Scalar</code> containers approach
to also handle native references, so we can optimize their creation away in
many more cases. This should lead to performance improvements in code that
makes use of native types.</li>
<li>Provide a way to attach dispatch programs a level down the callstack, which
may turn a megamorphic program point into a monomorphic one. For example, at
the moment, when we have a <code>proto</code> with a complex body and a <code>{*}</code>, the cache
at the <code>{*}</code> will end up with entries for all argument types that are seen.
However, if we were to locate the cache in the caller of the <code>proto</code>, we'd
often end up with only a single entry. The same applies in a number of other
situations (for example, the dispatch resumption is currently inside of the
<code>callsame</code> sub, so we scale poorly in large applications that use <code>callsame</code>
in many different places).</li>
<li>Use the dispatch mechanism to better optimize use of the FALLBACK method</li>
<li>Use the dispatch mechanism to better optimize various forms of Raku type
check</li>
<li>In the case we have specializations available, fold the selection of a
specialization into the dispatch program, avoiding repeated guard checks</li>
</ul>

<h2>Project Schedule</h2>

<p>I would start immediately upon grant approval, and expect to give a minimum of
40 hours a month to the grant, however more should be possible most months.</p>

<h2>Bio</h2>

<p>I am the founder and architect of MoarVM, the most popular runtime for Raku users,
and the architect of the Rakudo compiler. I have contributed to the implementation
of numerous Raku language features, and played a key role in the design of the
concurrent and parallel aspects of the language. I hold a degree in Computer Science
from the University of Cambridge, and actively work in the field of developer
tooling and compilation.</p>

<h2>Amount requested</h2>

<p>200 hours * $60 USD / hour = $12,000 USD</p>

    <title>Caught in the Middle With SEDOL</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://www.rabbitfarm.com/cgi-bin/blosxom/2021/10/24#pwc135" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The examples used here are from The Weekly Challenge problem statement and demonstrate 
the working solution.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Part 1&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You are given an integer. Write a script find out the middle 3-digits of the given 
integer, if possible, otherwise show a sensible error message.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Solution&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="perl"&gt;
use strict;
use warnings;
use POSIX;
sub middle_3{
    my($i) = @_;
    $i = abs($i);
    my $length = length($i);
    return "even number of digits" if $length % 2 == 0;
    return "too short" if $length &lt; 3;
    my $middle = ceil($length / 2);
    return substr($i, $middle - 2, 3);
}

MAIN:{
    print middle_3(1234567) . "\n";
    print middle_3(-123) . "\n";
    print middle_3(1) . "\n";
    print middle_3(10) . "\n";
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Sample Run&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="shell"&gt;
$ perl perl/ch-1.pl
345
123
too short
even number of digits
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Notes&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe on of the more interesting things about this is just what we consider the middle 3.
Truly it only makes sense for an integer with an odd number of digits. But could we 
have stretched the idea to allow for an even number of digits, perhaps with some left 
padding? Perhaps, but here we don't. So all integers with only 1 or 2 digits are discarded
as are those with an even number of digits. Negative numbers are allowed, but we do not
consider the minus sign in determining the middle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Part 2&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You are given 7-characters alphanumeric SEDOL. Write a script to validate the given 
SEDOL. Print 1 if it is a valid SEDOL otherwise 0.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Solution&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="perl"&gt;
use strict;
use warnings;
use boolean;

sub is_sedol{
    my($sedol) = @_;
    my $base = substr($sedol, 0, 6);
    my $check_digit = substr($sedol, 6, 1); 
    ##
    # check length
    ##
    return false if length($sedol) != 7;
    ##
    # check for alphanumerics only
    ##
    my $test_base = $base;
    $test_base =~ tr/[0-9][B-Z]//d;
    return false if $test_base;
    ##
    # confirm the check_digit
    ##
    return false if $check_digit != compute_check_digit($base);
    ##
    # all tests passed!
    ##
    return true;
}

sub compute_check_digit{
    my($base) = @_;
    my @chars = split(//, $base);
    my @weights = (1, 3, 1, 7, 3, 9),
    my $sum = 0;
    do{
        my $c = ord(shift @chars);
        if($c &gt;= 66 &amp;&amp; $c &lt;= 90){
            $sum += (($c - 64 + 9) * shift @weights);
        }
        if($c &gt;= 48 &amp;&amp; $c &lt;= 57){
            $sum += (($c - 48) * shift @weights);
        }
    }while(@chars);
    return (10 - ($sum % 10)) % 10
}

MAIN:{
    print is_sedol(2936921) . "\n";
    print is_sedol(1234567) . "\n";
    print is_sedol("B0YBKL9") . "\n";
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Sample Run&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="shell"&gt;
1
0
1
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Notes&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rules around SEDOLs are a bit more complex than this problem lets on. I won't recount
them all here, but suffice to say we are dealing with a quite idealized set of validations
here. For example, prior to 2004 only numerals were allowed, but since then letters are 
allowed. But only a numeral can follow a letter. Again, though, those are only rules that
apply for a certain time range.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here we are just checking on length, whether or not the SEDOl contains all numerals and/or
(uppercase) letter, and the checksum validation.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>#534 - Are you CPAN contributor?</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://perlweekly.com/archive/534.html" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Hi there</p>
<p>How much have you contributed during the Hacktoberfest event yet?</p>
<p>CPAN needs a helping hand, not just during Hacktoberfest. I am raising the subject as Dave Cross recently blogged about his experience with one of the distributions hosted on CPAN in this <a href="https://dev.to/davorg/failing-to-get-product-information-from-amazon-with-perl-5a3g">blog post</a>. It also reminds me of my early days when I created Perl a library around some of Google's public APIs. Two of them, <a href="https://metacpan.org/dist/WWW-Google-CustomSearch">WWW::Google::CustomSearch</a> and <a href="https://metacpan.org/dist/WWW-Google-Places">WWW::Google::Places</a> were used by many people, as I have had many queries related to them in the past. It is very common for an API provider to discontinue the service or move in a new direction any time without notice. It becomes an even bigger issue if the author of the CPAN distribution disappears from the scene. So the question is, how best to deal with such cases? Thanks to the PAUSE admins, there is a documented process to adopt a distribution and take it forward. You should get in touch with one of the PAUSE admins if you want to adopt a distribution and contribute.</p>
<p>For many years, <a href="https://metacpan.org/recent">MetaCPAN</a> has been my playground. I used to spend 2-4 hours every day looking for low-hanging issues in the recently uploaded distributions. I even wrote a two-part blog post talking about how to become a CPAN contributor. <a href="https://www.perl.com/article/how-to-become-cpan-contributor">Part 1</a> and <a href="https://www.perl.com/article/how-to-become-cpan-contributor-part-2">Part 2</a>. I also gave a talk at The Perl Conference in Glasgow 2018 on the same topic. You can watch the talk on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYN1nijo9VY">YouTube</a>, if you fancy.</p>
<p>I remember at one point, I was keen to contribute to MetaCPAN and be part of the Toolchain Gang. I couldn't get the local dev setup of MetaCPAN and was looking for help. I was told that someone from the gang is working on dockerisation of MetaCPAN to make it easier for anyone to contribute. I missed the opportunity to meet the gang when it was held in Marlow, not far from where I live (London) in 2019. I don't know if anyone is still working on that front.</p>
<p>I hardly contribute to CPAN these days but I still like to call myself CPAN contributor. However I do release a patch every now and then to some of my personal and adopted distributions. Being a member of the <a href="https://pullrequest.club/hello">Pull Request Club</a>, I do contribute to at least one distribution every month. I have never missed a month since I joined the club in Jan 2019.</p>
<p>If anyone is keen to become a CPAN contributor then please get in touch with me. We need fresh energy to make CPAN the central place to look for the best solutions.</p>
<p>Enjoy the rest of the newsletter.</p></div>

    <title>A Couple of Brute Force Computations</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://www.rabbitfarm.com/cgi-bin/blosxom/2021/10/17#pwc134" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The examples used here are from The Weekly Challenge problem statement and demonstrate 
the working solution.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Part 1&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Write a script to generate first 5 Pandigital Numbers in base 10.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Solution&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="perl"&gt;
use strict;
use warnings;
##
# Write a script to generate first 5 Pandigital Numbers in base 10.
##
use boolean;

sub first_n_pandigitals {
    my ($n)         = @_;
    my $found       = false;
    my $pandigitals = [];
    my $x           = 1_000_000_000;
    do {
        my $test = $x;
        push @{$pandigitals}, $x
          if ( $test =~ tr/0//d ) &gt; 0
          &amp;&amp; ( $test =~ tr/1//d ) &gt; 0
          &amp;&amp; ( $test =~ tr/2//d ) &gt; 0
          &amp;&amp; ( $test =~ tr/3//d ) &gt; 0
          &amp;&amp; ( $test =~ tr/4//d ) &gt; 0
          &amp;&amp; ( $test =~ tr/5//d ) &gt; 0
          &amp;&amp; ( $test =~ tr/6//d ) &gt; 0
          &amp;&amp; ( $test =~ tr/7//d ) &gt; 0
          &amp;&amp; ( $test =~ tr/8//d ) &gt; 0
          &amp;&amp; ( $test =~ tr/9//d ) &gt; 0;
        $found = ( @{$pandigitals} == $n );
        $x++;
    } while ( !$found );
    return $pandigitals;
}

sub first_5_pandigitals {
    return first_n_pandigitals(5);
}
MAIN: {
    my $pandigitals = first_5_pandigitals;
    for my $x ( @{$pandigitals} ) {
        print "$x\n";
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Sample Run&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="shell"&gt;
$ perl perl/ch-1.pl
1023456789
1023456798
1023456879
1023456897
1023456978
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Notes&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the definition we know that we will need at least 10 digits and, intuitively, the
first five pandigital numbers will start with &lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt;. So then, we start with &lt;code&gt;1_000_000_000&lt;/code&gt;
and iterate upwards testing each candidate until we find the first five. The test used
here is to determine if &lt;code&gt;tr&lt;/code&gt; finds all the required digits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Part 2&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You are given 2 positive numbers, $m and $n. Write a script to generate multiplication 
table and display count of distinct terms.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Solution&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="perl"&gt;
use strict;
use warnings;
##
# You are given 2 positive numbers, $m and $n.
# Write a script to generate multiplcation table and display count of distinct terms.
##
sub compute_print {
    my ( $m, $n ) = @_;
    my $distinct = {};
    print " x | " . join( " ", ( 1 .. $n ) ) . "\n";
    print "---+-" . "-" x ( $n * 2 - 1 ) . "\n";
    for my $i ( 1 .. $m ) {
        print " $i | " . join( " ", map { $i * $_ } ( 1 .. $n ) ) . "\n";
        for my $j ( 1 .. $n ) {
            $distinct-&gt;{ $i * $j } = undef;
        }
    }
    return $distinct;
}
MAIN: {
    my $distinct = compute_print( 3, 3 );
    print "Distinct Terms: "
      . join( ", ", sort { $a &lt;=&gt; $b } keys %{$distinct} ) . "\n";
    print "Count: " . keys( %{$distinct} ) . "\n";
    print "\n\n";
    $distinct = compute_print( 3, 5 );
    print "Distinct Terms: "
      . join( ", ", sort { $a &lt;=&gt; $b } keys %{$distinct} ) . "\n";
    print "Count: " . keys( %{$distinct} ) . "\n";
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Sample Run&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="shell"&gt;
$ perl perl/ch-2.pl
 x | 1 2 3
---+------
 1 | 1 2 3
 2 | 2 4 6
 3 | 3 6 9
Distinct Terms: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9
Count: 6


 x | 1 2 3 4 5
---+----------
 1 | 1 2 3 4 5
 2 | 2 4 6 8 10
 3 | 3 6 9 12 15
Distinct Terms: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 15
Count: 11
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Notes&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a perfectly Perl shaped problem. The computations can be handled in a 
straightforward way, especially with &lt;code&gt;map&lt;/code&gt;. Getting rid of duplicates is done using
the idiomatic method with hash keys. Finally, formatting the output cleanly is done 
without much undo stress. Compare what we do here to format the table with what was
necessary to represent the 
&lt;a href="http://www.rabbitfarm.com/cgi-bin/blosxom/2021/10/17/prolog"&gt;same table in Prolog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>#533 - Consulting work</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://perlweekly.com/archive/533.html" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Hi,</p>
<p>I just had a meeting with a company in the UK that were looking for some consulting in Perl. After our conversation I felt that what they are interested in is not really where my expertise is, so I referred them to two other people who have a lot more experience in those areas. However I realized I don't know who is providing consulting or development service these days. So let me know. Who knows next time I might be able to refer the clients to you.</p>
<p>On the other hand I just found out that my client, where I do some refactoring on a web-application with some machine-learning backend (written in Python). is likely to move the project to their parent company. This probably means I'll be free for other projects to introduce test automation, CI, and refactoring code.</p>
<p>Enjoy your week!</p></div>

<hr />

<p>In September I:</p>

<ul>
<li>got the OBS interfacing component working, and</li>
<li>got the GitHub interfacing component working.</li>
</ul>

<p>I hoped to manage to put a working system together this weekend. (Currently 
only integrating GitHub and OBS, so no separate Website and no interactive 
features yet.) That didn't quite work out, but there is not much missing. So 
I'm hopeful to do so in the coming days.</p>

  <title>Immediate writing to file - flushing in Perl without buffering</title>
  <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>
When we say we read from a file or write to a file in Perl (or any other language for that matter), we don't actually access the file directly and immediately. Instead of that we what we really do is that we ask the operating system to read from the file or write to the file using a "system call". The Operating system (Linux, OSX, Windows, etc.) will do the work on our behalf, but it will try to optimize.
<p>
So it won't go and write to the disk immediately when we ask it to write a few characters. Instead of that it will keep the request in memory in a "buffer" and will write it to the disk later, when the buffer is full or when the file is closed.

    <title>#532 - Hacktoberfest 2021</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://perlweekly.com/archive/532.html" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Hi there</p>
<p>Have you joined the annual <a href="https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com">Hacktoberfest 2021</a> run by Digital Ocean?</p>
<p>If not then please join without any further delay. Hacktoberfest encourages participation in the open source community. You can earn a limited edition T-shirt by completing the challenge.</p>
<p>Not sure if you noticed, but this time they have made an interesting change by allowing open source maintainers to also take part in the contest. Ever since I started <a href="https://theweeklychallenge.org">The Weekly Challenge</a>, I have hardly found time to dedicate to Hacktoberfest. Last year I could only submit 6 PRs, enough to win the contest, since you only need to submit 4 PRs. This year, I am only taking part as the maintainer of an open source project - "The Weekly Challenge". The best year for me as contributor was 2019 when I submitted 160 PRs.</p>
<p>If you are looking for an open source project to contribute to then you can join "The Weekly Challenge" and win the competition by submitting 4 PRs in just one week.</p>
<p>How?</p>
<p>Well, you could submit 2 Perl and 2 Raku solutions to the weekly task. Just submit one solution per PR. I know it is cheating but a fair one in my humble opinion. Again, please don't limit yourself to just Perl and Raku. You are free to choose your favourite programming language. One more bit, please don't tie yourself to the current weekly challenge. You are free pick any past week challenges. Plenty of choices available. If you have any questions with regard to submitting a PR then please follow the <a href="https://theweeklychallenge.org/blog/how-to-contribute">blog post</a> that explains every detail. If you still have any questions then please get in touch with me. You can find my details on the page. I am also accepting PRs to another open source project - <a href="https://github.com/manwar/theweeklychallenge">The Weekly Challenge</a> website which is also open source code.</p>
<p>If you are a CPAN contributor then you could pick and choose your favourite distribution and contribute. However there is a catch, the distribution may or may not be part of the contest. Having said that, you can contribute to my <a href="https://metacpan.org/author/MANWAR">CPAN distributions</a> if you fancy. I promise, I will make the distribution to be part of the contest so that your PR will count towards the target. Just yesterday, I received a <a href="https://github.com/manwar/BankAccount-Validator-UK/pull/2">Pull Request</a> on one of my CPAN distributions, <a href="https://metacpan.org/dist/BankAccount-Validator-UK">BankAccount::Validator::UK</a>.</p>
<p>Happy Hacking !!!</p></div>
