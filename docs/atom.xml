     <p>This is a statement from the TPF Board of Directors.</p>

<p>We screwed up. The TPF Board failed to make sure that the first significant test of the new CAT team and process went well. For that, <strong>we deeply apologize</strong>.</p>

<p>This post will go into detail on exactly what we think went wrong, clarify a number of points, and explain how we plan to do better in the future.</p>

<p>Our first mistake was a focus on responding quickly to the incident reported to the CAT. Because of that, the <a href="https://news.perlfoundation.org/post/cat-transparency-repor-19-april-2021">first transparency report</a> that was published was based on a draft that had not been reviewed or approved by the board. This is because the board failed to clarify the process for publishing this report.</p>

<p>Then, having moved too quickly, we were too slow to provide a correction. It took two weeks to publish <a href="https://news.perlfoundation.org/post/cat-transparency-report-updates0">the update</a>. In addition, that update did not do a good enough job of acknowledging that the first report should not have been published as is.</p>

<p>Finally, it's taken us another three weeks to publish this apology.</p>

<p>During this drawn out time, people in the Perl and Raku communities have been free to assume the worst, and a lot of misinformation has been going around uncorrected. This is entirely our fault.</p>

<p><strong>All of this has harmed our communities, harmed TPF, and harmed Perl and Raku.</strong></p>

<p>Why did this all drag out so long? Simply put, TPF is not an organization designed to move quickly. This is no one's fault. In the past, we haven't generally needed to do so. We are an entirely volunteer organization, including the board, which is made up of people spread around the world. Even finding a time where a quorum can meet is not straightforward.</p>

<p>The board has not delegated significant authority to any one individual who could have handled this incident by themselves. We have no Executive Director or any similar role. This means decision making is always done through discussion and voting.</p>

<p>Realistically, this aspect of TPF is unlikely to change. What we can do is work much harder to prevent situations that need quick responses from occurring in the first place.</p>

<h2>Transparency Report Mistakes</h2>

<p>The initial response asserted authority over aspects of the communities which are not TPF's responsibility, such as IRC, mailing lists, etc. <strong>That was simply wrong, because we do not have any authority over those services or spaces.</strong></p>

<p><strong>The initial consequence was both too harsh and poorly worded.</strong> The lifetime ban was not intended to be a "permaban", but was supposed to be an <em>indefinite</em> ban that would be lifted when the person in question demonstrated that they would not repeat their unacceptable behavior. <strong>But as was noted in the update, a lifetime ban was too harsh.</strong> And the part about this ban being reversible was simply missing from the initial report.</p>

<p>In the update, this was changed to a minimum 1 year ban. However, there were concerns in the community around this particular statement:</p>

<p>&gt; Unacceptable behavior within that 1 year period could lead to an extension or modification of the length or the terms of the ban. This includes interactions between the Subject and others in the Perl and Raku communities, even outside of TPF events and online platforms.</p>

<p>Some people interpreted "includes interactions between the Subject and others in the Perl and Raku communities" as saying that any interaction between the Subject and others in the Perl and Raku communities was grounds for extending the ban.</p>

<p>That was not the intended reading. <strong>Instead, the intended reading is that further unacceptable behavior would be grounds for extending the ban.</strong> Unacceptable behavior includes treating others in a disrespectful manner, harassment, or not respecting another person's desire to end a conversation.</p>

<h2>Other Concerns</h2>

<p><strong>A number of people in the community have stated that the Subject received no communication from the CAT before the post on the TPF blog went live. This is not true.</strong> The Subject was invited to a meeting with the CAT before the post went live, agreed to meet at a specified time, and then did not show up at that time. However, the Subject has met with the CAT since the initial report was posted.</p>

<p>Other people have expressed concern that the Subject was not allowed to present a case for their defense. The exact process of how Standards of Conduct violations should be handled is a larger topic than we can cover here. However, we do want to note that this is not a legal process, and cannot be modeled on such processes. We do not have the time, resources, or expertise to treat each case like a legal case, with a prosecution, defense, judge, and jury.</p>

<p><strong>However, we can and do commit to developing a process for handling complaints with input from the community.</strong> See later in this post for more details.</p>

<h2>Moving Forward</h2>

<p>Even though we made many mistakes, there are some parts of this affair that we do stand by.</p>

<p>Among our responsibilities, TPF runs the annual Perl and Raku Conference in North America. We cannot allow the conference to be an unsafe space. The conference is not the only space for which we are responsible, but it is our flagship. Because of that, we have an obligation to respond to Standards of Conduct complaints in order to make sure that all conference attendees feel welcome.</p>

<p>A credible complaint was made to us that ongoing problem behavior was driving one or more people from the community. The CAT investigated and felt that this complaint was correct. Because of our commitment to creating a welcoming and inclusive environment, the CAT and the board agreed that there needed to be consequences for the Subject of the investigation. We still believe that to be the case, and we are not going to reverse the final decision to issue a minimum one year ban on conference participation or participation in other TPF activities and spaces, including the TPF Slack.</p>

<p>Moreover, we are not going to dissolve the CAT or stop enforcing the Standards of Conduct, especially given that this year's conference is happening again in just four weeks.</p>

<p>Our initial postings made it sound like we think TPF gets to make decisions about every place that people gather to talk about Perl. We don't think that. We would like to help establish common expectations of what kind of behavior creates a healthy environment for interaction. We know that our missteps here have created obstacles for us to overcome, but we think the mission is worth pursuing, and that we have a responsibility to pursue it.</p>

<p>As it stands now, the CAT is in a holding pattern while the board reviews its charter and we work to define a process for handling these complaints. It won't be taking action until that's done, unless the board explicitly approves that action. We do plan to produce those documents, and we take that process seriously, both because we acknowledge the mistakes made so far and because we believe in the goal of making TPF spaces as welcoming as possible.</p>

<p>We will form an SoC team solely for the conference. They will handle incident reports during the conference. Their powers will include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Issuing warnings to conference participants.</li>
<li>Removing people from conference chat.</li>
<li>Stop a presentation if it contains unacceptable content.</li>
<li>Placing a temporary hold on publishing a presentation to YouTube.</li>
<li>Temporarily removing an already published presentation.</li>
</ul>

<p>Any further consequences, including permanently removing a presentation from YouTube, will be reviewed by the board.</p>

<p>If you would like to provide input on the charter or the process, please <a href="https://join.slack.com/t/perlfoundation/shared_invite/zt-phfb4e13-uAqqK956F0u8bTStSY8RTQ">join the #tpf-cat Slack channel</a>. (Note that this link expires on May 26. Email <a href="mailto:board@perlfoundation.org">board@perlfoundation.org</a> if you'd like to join after that time and we will invite you.)</p>

    <title>A list of Perl list processing modules</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://dev.to/mjgardner/a-list-of-perl-list-processing-modules-51jj" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><a href="https://phoenixtrap.com/2021/03/16/perl_map_grep/">As previously written</a>, I like list processing. Many computing problems can be broken down into transforming and filtering lists, and <strong>Perl has got the fundamentals <a href="https://perldoc.pl/perlfunc#Functions-for-list-data">covered</a></strong> with functions like <a href="https://perldoc.pl/functions/map"><code>map</code></a>, <a href="https://perldoc.pl/functions/grep"><code>grep</code></a>, and <a href="https://perldoc.pl/functions/sort"><code>sort</code></a>. There is so much more you might want to do, though, and <a href="https://www.cpan.org/">CPAN</a> has a plethora of list and array processing modules.</p>

<p>However, due to the vicissitudes of Perl module maintenance, we have a situation where it’s not clear at a glance where to turn when you’ve got a list that needs processing. So here’s another list: <strong>the list modules of CPAN</strong>. Click through to discover what functions they provide.</p>

<ul>
<li>We’ve got <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/List::Util"><strong>List::Util</strong></a> which has been released as part of Perl since version 5.7.3.</li>
<li>We’ve got <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/List::MoreUtils"><strong>List::MoreUtils</strong></a> which has some functions which are named the same as Util but behave differently.</li>
<li>We’ve got <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/List::SomeUtils"><strong>List::SomeUtils</strong></a> which duplicates MoreUtils but with fewer dependencies.</li>
<li>We’ve got <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/List::UtilsBy"><strong>List::UtilsBy</strong></a> which MoreUtils has also cribbed some functions from.</li>
<li>We’ve got <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/List::AllUtils"><strong>List::AllUtils</strong></a> which attempts to consolidate Util, SomeUtils, and ListBy but has some exceptions to called modules because of the aforementioned duplication between Util and SomeUtils.</li>
<li>We’ve got <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/List::Util::MaybeXS"><strong>List::Util::MaybeXS</strong></a> which helps with pure Perl fallbacks in case your version of Util is too old to have a certain function.</li>
<li>We’ve got <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/List::MoreUtils::XS"><strong>List::MoreUtils::XS</strong></a> which provides (some?) faster versions of MoreUtils’ functions (but you still have to <code>use</code> MoreUtils).</li>
<li>And lastly, we have <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Util::Any"><strong>Util::Any</strong></a> which lets you import functions from Util, MoreUtils, and just for good measure <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Scalar::Util">Scalar::Util</a>, <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Hash::Util">Hash::Util</a>, <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/String::Util">String::Util</a>, <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/String::CamelCase">String::CamelCase</a>, <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/List::Pairwise">List::Pairwise</a>, and <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Data::Dumper">Data::Dumper</a>. But it hasn’t been updated since 2016, so it doesn’t necessarily export the functions added to those modules since then.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Am I missing anything? Probably!</strong> But these are the ones most associated with being upstream on the <a href="http://neilb.org/tag/cpan-river/">CPAN River</a>, so they (or the modules they consolidate) have more projects depending on them.</p>

     <p>In April I focused on resumption of multiple dispatch using the new dispatch mechanism - that is, using <code>callsame</code> to move to the next candidate. I observed that moving between candidates with <code>where</code> clauses is largely the same process, and was able to factor things in such a way as to exploit these commonalities.</p>

<p>The mechanism I implemented to achieve this turns failure to bind a signature into a dispatch resumption, but with the frame that we couldn't bind removed from the call stack. While doing this work, I realized that a very similar mechanism - run some code, and resume with its return value - could come in highly useful for handling fallbacks for megamorphic callsites, where we want to run some more complex lookup code rather than building an enormous pile of inline cache entries.</p>

<p>I also hunted down a couple of implementation bugs in the dispatch mechanism shown up by testing: a thinko leading to an infinite loop in a GC mark routine, and a data race involving the allocation of storage for dispatch caches that could afflict some multi-threaded programs.</p>

<p>Finally, I started preparing the way for gradually moving towards using the new dispatcher for all dispatch in Rakudo. With the current grant hours almost being exhausted, I also submitted a grant application for the next round of TPF grants.</p>

Total time worked: 15 hours 19 minutes

    <title>Developing a script in small steps</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://dev.to/vkroll/common-misconception-of-beginners-51jb" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It all started with a git commit I found: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;commit 340d908fe537d3163e220c84945bbfc5b49fe8dc&lt;br&gt;
Author: A.&lt;br&gt;
Date:   Wed Apr 14 17:28:50 2021 +0200&lt;br&gt;
Deleted redundant INFO messages. Replaced date strings with dt-&amp;gt;ymd() calls. Replaced some if nots with unless. Simplified sub _unpack. Set timezone in DateTime objects. Results are returned as tail calls now. Maybe more minor changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A. is a fresh developer in my department and as many future devs she did not learn so far - neither in university nor in books - how to organize her work. How to avoid commits ending with &lt;strong&gt;Maybe more minor changes.&lt;/strong&gt; Honestly I know a lot senior devs who still use a version control system like any other backup. So what I wanted to show her, was: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to organize my programming in small steps&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How slowly developing &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to make errors without desaster&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to use your version control&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to write a helpful commit-message&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How will I later find something I did&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I started a programming-session on my own, and gave her later the repository and we discussed each step. (Honestly: She found immediately an error in my code, that I did not left there intentionally).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The development was in perl, but I hope other devs find the steps valueable too, so I write it down here. (My first longer article in english)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#step-one-all-started-with-a-readme"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Step one: all started with a README
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;- Script with parameters
    -d Date
        -&amp;gt; has to be in the past
        -&amp;gt; must be no older then 7 days

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Of course that was the first commit: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;README&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;we will have the requirements here&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#now-the-fun-started-the-initial-script"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Now the fun started, the initial script
&lt;/h1&gt;



&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;use strict;

use Getopt::Long;

my $date ; ## the startingdate

GetOptions(
        "date=s"         =&amp;gt; \$date,
        );

print "submitted Date is: $date\n";
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The perl people know, that script does not much more then storing a submitted string as parameter --date or -d in the scalar variable $date.&lt;br&gt;
And of course it uses strict as every good perl script does. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I committed this change: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;initial&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Parameter d for the date&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TODO:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Validation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#as-promised-a-validation"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  As promised a validation
&lt;/h1&gt;


&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;## starts as before
sub is_date {
    my $date = shift;

    return 1 if $date =~ /^\d\d\d\d-\d\d-\d\d$/;
    return 0;

}
if(is_date($date)) {
    print "submitted Date is: $date\n";
}
else {
    print "submitted value $date is no date\n";
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I checked if the submitted date matches the regex &lt;code&gt;^\d\d\d\d-\d\d-\d\d$&lt;/code&gt; - you are aware, that we perl-devs solve our problems with regexes right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But enough for the next commit&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Author: Volker Kroll &lt;br&gt;
Date:   Wed May 5 16:54:49 2021 +0200&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;first check for date&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;date is valid if regex \d\d\d\d-\d\d-\d\d is valid&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TODO:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;better check&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;exclude non valid month and day&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#more-checks"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  More checks
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As announced the next step was to better check for the validity of the date  - and stay tuned these steps will be changed later.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;sub is_date {
    my $date = shift;

    my $days = ["", 31, 29, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31];

    my($y, $m, $d) = $date =~ /^(\d\d\d\d)-(\d\d)-(\d\d)$/;
    if ($m &amp;gt; 0 &amp;amp;&amp;amp; $m &amp;lt; 13) {
        print "$m has max $days-&amp;gt;[$m] days\n";
        return 1 if $d &amp;lt;= $days-&amp;gt;[$m];
    }

    return 0;

}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And the next commit even though theses checks are far from perfect&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Author: Volker Kroll &lt;br&gt;
Date:   Wed May 5 17:00:23 2021 +0200&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;more checking of date via regex&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;added length per month value&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;check if day is possible in the month&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TODO:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;that is a bad choice for february&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#lets-correct-the-february"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Let's correct the february
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we saw, my checks did not really work in february - only in leap-years, so I had to handle that with a check wether it is a leap year or not.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;sub is_date {
    my $date = shift;

    my $days = ["", 31, 28, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31];

    my($y, $m, $d) = $date =~ /^(\d\d\d\d)-(\d\d)-(\d\d)$/;
    if (is_leap_year($y)) {
        $days-&amp;gt;[2] = 29;
    }

    if ($m &amp;gt; 0 &amp;amp;&amp;amp; $m &amp;lt; 13) {
        print "$m has max $days-&amp;gt;[$m] days\n";
        return 1 if $d &amp;lt;= $days-&amp;gt;[$m];
    }
    return 0;
}

sub is_leap_year {
    my $y = shift;

    if ($y % 4 == 0) {
        return 1 if $y % 400 == 0;
        return 0 if $y % 100 == 0;
        return 1;
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now february is handled correctly in every year. So, up the next commit&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;new function is_leap_year
TODO&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Refactoring - Removing of all own written calendar functions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#refactoring-use-of-date-modules"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Refactoring - Use of Date Modules
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had to remove my not so elegant and error-prone date-functions. To get you back on track, here is the whole script after removing that and adding a suitable date module&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;use strict;

use Getopt::Long;
use DateTime;

my $date ; ## the startingdate

GetOptions(
        "date=s"         =&amp;gt; \$date,
        );

sub is_date {
    my $date = shift;

    my $days = ["", 31, 28, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31];

    my($y, $m, $d) = $date =~ /^(\d\d\d\d)-(\d\d)-(\d\d)$/;
    my $dt;
    eval {
        $dt = DateTime-&amp;gt;new(year =&amp;gt; $y, month =&amp;gt; $m, day =&amp;gt; $d);
    }; 
    if ($@) {
        print STDERR "Error while generating DateTime: $@\n";
        return 0;
    }
    else {
        return $dt;
    }
}


if(is_date($date)) {
    print "submitted Date is: $date\n";
}
else {
    print "submitted value $date is no date\n";
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I am using now &lt;a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/DateTime"&gt;DateTime&lt;/a&gt; for every date operation. If no DateTime object can be created we assume, that the submitted value is not correct and return 0, else we return a DateTime Object.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Author: Volker Kroll &lt;br&gt;
Date:   Wed May 5 17:24:41 2021 +0200&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;removed own calendar functions and added DateTime&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;validation via Exception of DateTime-&amp;gt;new()&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TODO:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Refactoring: rename function is_date (returns a dt if true)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe you saw, that I forgot to remove the arry with the days per month... I saw it now, while I write this article&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#clean-it-up-12"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Clean it up 1/2
&lt;/h1&gt;



&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;use strict;

use Getopt::Long;
use DateTime;

my $date;   ## the starting date argument
my $dt;     ## DateTime Object of starting date


GetOptions(
        "date=s"         =&amp;gt; \$date,
        );

sub get_dt {
    my $date = shift;

    my $days = ["", 31, 28, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31];

    my($y, $m, $d) = $date =~ /^(\d\d\d\d)-(\d\d)-(\d\d)$/;
    my $dt;
    eval {
        $dt = DateTime-&amp;gt;new(year =&amp;gt; $y, month =&amp;gt; $m, day =&amp;gt; $d);
    }; 
    if ($@) {
        print STDERR "Error while generating DateTime: $@\n";
        return 0;
    }
    else {
        return $dt;
    }
}

$dt = get_dt($date);

if($dt) {
    print "submitted Date is: $date\n";
}
else {
    print "submitted value $date is no date\n";
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Everything I did is mentioned in the commit-message (and there is still that array of days...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Author: Volker Kroll &lt;br&gt;
Date:   Wed May 5 17:28:04 2021 +0200&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;moved function is_date to get_dt&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;check is now if return of get_dt is a true value
 a DateTime Object is a true value
 0 is not
 =&amp;gt; so the check still works
 =&amp;gt; so we have already a working DateTime Object to work with later&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#clean-it-up-22"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Clean it up 2/2
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I moved around the code a bit to make it more readable&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;use strict;

use Getopt::Long;
use DateTime;

my $date;   ## the starting date argument
my $dt;     ## DateTime Object of starting date


GetOptions(
        "date=s"         =&amp;gt; \$date,
        );

$dt = get_dt($date);

if($dt) {
    print "submitted Date is: $date\n";
}
else {
    print "submitted value $date is no date\n";
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The sub get_dt remained the same (and there is still that array)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Author: Volker Kroll&lt;br&gt;
Date:   Wed May 5 17:31:00 2021 +0200&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;moved main code up in the file&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#now-for-more-functionality"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Now for more functionality
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we remember the day has to be in the past. So we need to check that. DateTime Objects can easily be compared and DateTime has a function called today(). So my first step was:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;$dt = get_dt($date);
my $today = DateTime-&amp;gt;today();



if(!$dt) {
    print "submitted value $date is no date\n";
}
if($dt &amp;lt; $today) {
    print "submitted date is in the past\n";
}

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That was easy and it worked out of the box.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Author: Volker Kroll &lt;br&gt;
Date:   Wed May 5 17:33:56 2021 +0200&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;check if submitted date is in the past&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;added new DateTime Object $today&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;compare $today and DateTime Object of submitted date&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TODO&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;next check: not older then 7 days (see README)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#but-first-lets-remove-this-array"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  But first let's remove this array....
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think you know how a not existing line looks nevertheless that was worth a commit&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Author: Volker Kroll &lt;br&gt;
Date:   Wed May 5 17:37:45 2021 +0200&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;removed old arrayref for days in the month&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#check-if-it-was-in-the-last-week"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Check if it was in the last week
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our requirements was that the date has to be in the last seven days. (Whatever that means in detail)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Time for another Date Module &lt;a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/DateTime::Duration"&gt;DateTime::Duration&lt;/a&gt; to calculate that difference.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;if(is_last_week($dt)) {
    print "submitted date was in the last week\n";
}

sub is_last_week {
    my $dt = shift;
    return unless ref $dt eq "DateTime";

    my $dur = DateTime::Duration-&amp;gt;new(days =&amp;gt; 7);
    $dt-&amp;gt;add_duration($dur);
    return 1 if $today &amp;lt; $dt;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I think that code is easily to understand even for not perl-devs. I add 7 days to the submitted date and compare it with today. (Here is the error that my colleague found immediatly - but more about the bug later).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Author: Volker Kroll &lt;br&gt;
Date:   Wed May 5 17:45:57 2021 +0200&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;check for is_last_week&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;added DateTime::Duration&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;checked if submitted date was in the last 7 days&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TODO:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Refactoring: Add the check for in the past in is_last_week&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#cleanup"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Cleanup
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As mentioned in the TODO we removed the "is in the past" check from the main and added it to the is_last_week&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;sub is_last_week {
    my $dt = shift;
    return unless ref $dt eq "DateTime";
    return if($dt &amp;gt; $today) ;

    my $dur = DateTime::Duration-&amp;gt;new(days =&amp;gt; 7);
    $dt-&amp;gt;add_duration($dur);
    return 1 if $today &amp;lt; $dt;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Normally all this would end with the this commit:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Author: Volker Kroll &lt;a href="mailto:kroll@strato.de"&gt;kroll@strato.de&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Date:   Wed May 5 17:48:31 2021 +0200&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;is_last_week now a valid check for date concerning to specification&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-bug"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The bug
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I wrote before, my colleague spotted a bug in my code. I got this question via chat:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A:     The line $dt-&amp;gt;add_duration($dur); made me wonder. Is the dt object not changed then? Is this call by value or call by reference?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And she was right. So the next commit was from her, modifying my code and correcting it.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;diff --git a/skript.pl b/skript.pl
index 2f5594b..426c4af 100644
--- a/skript.pl
+++ b/skript.pl
@@ -30,7 +30,8 @@ sub is_last_week {
     return if($dt &amp;gt; $today) ;

     my $dur = DateTime::Duration-&amp;gt;new(days =&amp;gt; 7);
-    $dt-&amp;gt;add_duration($dur);
+    #$dt-&amp;gt;add_duration($dur);
+    $today-&amp;gt;subtract_duration($dur);
     return 1 if $today &amp;lt; $dt;
 }
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She changed the direction of the math and modified the no longer used $today&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Author: A.&lt;br&gt;
Date:   Fri May 7 12:38:15 2021 +0200&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;is_last_week subtracts from today instead of adding to dt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now the script was correct concerning the requirements. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#conclusions"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Conclusions
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course this is a little bit artificial - and most devs will need to confess that they usually commit much bigger chunks of code. Nevertheless, I think it is valuable to develop in these small chunks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next steps were making it a bit more modular and added automated tests for further development. But for today this shall be enough.&lt;/p&gt;

<hr />

<p>RakuAST continues to grow to cover more of the Raku language, and the new RakuAST-based compiler frontend advances along with it. This month saw 30 further spectest files start passing in full using the new compiler frontend.</p>

<p>New AST nodes were created and compilation implemented for the following language constructs:</p>

<ul>
<li>Placeholder parameters, both positional and named</li>
<li>Sigilless variable declarations</li>

<ul>
<li>Correctly compile the smartmatch operator (the RHS should be evaluated with the LHS as the topic)</li>
<li>Compile the <code>:=</code> bind operator, except signature-based destructuring</li>
<li>Fix a bug in the compilation of <code>loop</code> without a condition</li>
<li>Parse and attach parameter traits</li>
<li>Implement compilation of signature binding for the <code>is rw</code> and <code>is raw</code> traits</li>
<li>Parse <code>my sub ...</code></li>
<li>Fix a compilation bug with <code>if /foo/ {}</code></li>

      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><a href="https://perlweeklychallenge.org/blog/perl-weekly-challenge-113/">Challenge</a>, <a href="https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/tree/master/challenge-113/sgreen">My solutions</a></p>

  TASK #1 › Represent Integer
</h1>

<h2>
  <a href="#task">
  </a>
  Task
</h2>

<p>You are given a positive integer <code>$N</code> and a digit <code>$D</code>.</p>

<p>Write a script to check if <code>$N</code> can be represented as a sum of positive integers having <code>$D</code> at least once. If check passes print <code>1</code> otherwise <code>0</code>.</p>

<h2>
  <a href="#my-solution">
  </a>
  My solution
</h2>

<p>On my commute home, I thought this was really straight forward. If I can multiply <code>$D</code> by a certain number of times and have a remainder that is a multiple of ten, then we have an answer. It works for the two examples provided.</p>

<p>However that won't always work. Take '103' and '5' as an example. A solution of 58 + 45 is valid, but doesn't meet the above criteria. Bugger.</p>

<p>First off I short circuit two possible solutions and exit if either is true. The first is if <code>$N</code> contains the digit <code>$D</code>. The second is if <code>$N</code> is divisible by <code>$D</code> with no remainder. Simples.</p>

<p>Now it's time to determine if any combination of two or more eligible numbers can be used to find a solution. For this part I create an array <code>@numbers</code> which contain all numbers from 1 to one less than the target that contain the digit <code>$D</code>, ordered from highest to lowest. Ideally this will give us the shortest solution, but not always. For example using an input of 37 and 2 will show up as 29 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 rather than 25 + 12.</p>

<p>I then use a recursive function <code>_find_numbers</code> to see if there is a working solution. The parameters are the remaining target, the list of numbers used in this calculation, and the array of all possible numbers (the list in the above paragraph).</p>

<p>Finally I display the solution, including the calculation (or <code>0</code> if there is none).</p>

<p>I'm really not sure if the recursive function is the best solution. I tend to use it when it's not always needed. If I wasn't going to use a recursive function my alternate was to started with <code>@numbers</code> and then use a map to create a two dimensional array of all possible combinations while removing any sums exceeding the target. And keep adding combinations until we have exhausted all possible solutions.</p>

  TASK #2 › Recreate Binary Tree
</h1>

<h2>
  <a href="#task">
  </a>
  Task
</h2>

<p>You are given a Binary Tree.</p>

<p>Write a script to replace each node of the tree with the sum of all the remaining nodes.</p>

<h2>
  <a href="#my-solution">
  </a>
  My solution
</h2>

<p>After being criticised in both challenge 093 and 094 for parsing the input as a file, I'm taking a different tact for this task, and probably being a bit too liberal in doing so.</p>

<p>The idea is to provide the list in a JSON or YAML format and it will output the solution the same format. As readers of my blogs will know, I generally don't use non core modules. The beauty of my solution is that it doesn't actually care what the format is.</p>

<p>With that in mind, I do two simple steps. The first is to get a sum of all numbers in the string. The second is to replace all numbers with the sum minus that number.</p>

<p>If JSON is used, this can be prettified by using a tool like <a href="https://stedolan.github.io/jq/">jq</a> or <a href="http://mikefarah.github.io/yq/">yq</a></p>

<p>Happy Idd to all the readers of the newsletter.</p>
<p>We should try to avoid all the negativity around us and focus on every little success story. I know it is not easy but we shouldn't give up without a fight. Nowadays, social media platforms play a vital role in spreading news. So if you do come across any success story please share it with the community. It helps as morale booster.</p>
<p>I would like to specially mention two stories this week, <a href="https://news.perlfoundation.org/post/newcomer-survey-results-actions">Andrew Solomon's survey results and actions taken</a> and <a href="http://blogs.perl.org/users/dean/2021/05/a-perl-community-dashboard.html">Dean's proposed community dashboard</a>. Kudos to Andrew and Dean for taking the initiative. Keep it up.</p>
<p>Enjoy the rest of the newsletter.</p></div>

    <title>The Weekly Challenge 112</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://www.rabbitfarm.com/cgi-bin/blosxom/2021/05/16#pwc112" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The examples used here are from the weekly challenge problem statement and demonstrate 
the working solution.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Part 1&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Write a script to convert the given absolute path to the simplified canonical path.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Solution&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="perl"&gt;
use strict;
use warnings;
##
# Write a script to convert the given absolute path to the simplified canonical path.
# The canonical path format:
#     - The path starts with a single slash '/'.
#     - Any two directories are separated by a single slash '/'.
#     - The path does not end with a trailing '/'.
#     - The path only contains the directories on the path from the root directory to the target file or directory
##
sub leading_slash{
    my($path) = @_;
    $path = "/" . $path if substr($path, 0, 1) ne "/";
    return $path;  
}

sub single_seperator{
    my($path) = @_;
    $path =~ s#\/\/#\/#;
    return $path;  
}

sub trailing_slash{
    my($path) = @_;
    chop($path) if substr($path, length($path) - 1, 1) eq "/";
    return $path; 
}

sub up_stay{
    my($path) = @_;
    my @directories = split(/\//, substr($path, 1)); 
    my @temp_path; 
    for my $d (@directories){
        push @temp_path, $d if $d ne "." &amp;&amp; $d ne ".."; 
        pop @temp_path if $d eq ".."; 
        next if $d eq ".";      
    }  
    return "/" . join("/", @temp_path);   
}

sub canonical_path{
    my($path) = @_; 
    return up_stay(trailing_slash(single_seperator(leading_slash($path))));  
} 

MAIN:{
    while(&lt;DATA&gt;){
        chomp;
        print canonical_path($_) . "\n"; 
    }  
}

__DATA__
/a/
/a/b//c/
/a/b/c/../..
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Sample Run&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="shell"&gt;
$ perl perl/ch-1.pl
/a
/a/b/c
/a
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Notes&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The challenge I set for myself here was to completely avoid any use of regular 
expressions! I think I pulled it off, more or less. I am not quite sure I covered every
possible corner case, but it works for the examples given.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Part 2&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You are given $n steps to climb. Write a script to find out the distinct ways to climb 
to the top. You are allowed to climb either 1 or 2 steps at a time.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Solution&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="perl"&gt;
use strict;
use warnings;
##
# You are given $n steps to climb
# Write a script to find out the distinct ways to climb to the top.
# You are allowed to climb either 1 or 2 steps at a time.
##
use Array::Compare;
use Algorithm::Combinatorics q/variations_with_repetition/;

sub steps{
    my($k) = @_;
    my @data = (0, 1, 2);
    my @steps;
    my $comparison = new Array::Compare();
    my $iterator = variations_with_repetition(\@data, $k);
    while(my $combination = $iterator-&gt;next()){
        if(unpack("%32C*", pack("C*", @{$combination})) == $k){
            my $step = [grep {$_ != 0} @{$combination}];
            push @steps, $step if(!grep {$comparison-&gt;compare($_, $step)} @steps);
        }
    }
    return @steps;
}

MAIN:{
    my @steps;
    @steps = steps(3);
    print "k = 3\n";
    for my $steps (@steps){
        my $option;
        for my $step (@{$steps}){
            $option .=  "$step step + "  if $step == 1;
            $option .=  "$step steps + " if $step == 2;
        }
        chop($option);
        chop($option);
        print "$option\n";
    }

        my $option;

            $option .=  "$step steps + " if $step == 2;
        }
        chop($option);
        chop($option);
        print "$option\n";
    }
    @steps = steps(5);
    print "\nk = 5\n";
    for my $steps (@steps){
        my $option;
        for my $step (@{$steps}){
            $option .=  "$step step + "  if $step == 1;
            $option .=  "$step steps + " if $step == 2;
        }
        chop($option);
        chop($option);
        print "$option\n";
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Sample Run&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="shell"&gt;
$ perl perl/ch-2.pl
k = 3
1 step + 2 steps
2 steps + 1 step
1 step + 1 step + 1 step

k = 4
2 steps + 2 steps
1 step + 1 step + 2 steps
1 step + 2 steps + 1 step
2 steps + 1 step + 1 step
1 step + 1 step + 1 step + 1 step

k = 5
1 step + 2 steps + 2 steps
2 steps + 1 step + 2 steps
2 steps + 2 steps + 1 step
1 step + 1 step + 1 step + 2 steps
1 step + 1 step + 2 steps + 1 step
1 step + 2 steps + 1 step + 1 step
2 steps + 1 step + 1 step + 1 step
1 step + 1 step + 1 step + 1 step + 1 step
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Notes&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather than pursue some sort of algorithmic elegance and optimization I decided to 
try what is effectively a brute force approach. For small values of &lt;code&gt;$k&lt;/code&gt; this works quite
nicely with the above example output generated in about a second on very modest hardware
(an approximately 20 year old 450Mhz G4 Power Macintosh). Naturally we face a 
&lt;em&gt;combinatorial explosion&lt;/em&gt; for larger values of &lt;code&gt;$k&lt;/code&gt;. For larger input values consider
a graph search with memoization!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overview of this brute force approach:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Generate all arrays of numbers of length &lt;code&gt;$k&lt;/code&gt; using digits 0, 1, and 2.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep all those arrays that sum to &lt;code&gt;$k&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remove zeroes from these matching arrays
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remove duplicate arrays 
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Combinations are generated using 
&lt;a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Algorithm::Combinatorics"&gt;Algorithm::Combinatorics&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Duplicate array removal is facilitated by 
&lt;a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Array::Compare"&gt;Array::Compare&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;References&lt;/h2&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In our &lt;a href="https://dev.to/raigaurav/getting-ready-for-production-jio"&gt;previous&lt;/a&gt; article we have created a Dockerfile for our &lt;a href="https://mojolicious.org/"&gt;Mojolicious&lt;/a&gt; application. In there I mentioned that we have to run several docker command and when we map it across different environment we have to take care of different permutations and combinations.&lt;br&gt;
What if we can automate it more. What if we can abstract the complexity and as a user I just have to run minimum command to get it working.&lt;br&gt;
Here comes the Makefile. We will be using this to make our process more easier. For windows you can use &lt;code&gt;gmake.exe&lt;/code&gt; utility instead of &lt;code&gt;make&lt;/code&gt;. It comes with Strawberry Perl.&lt;br&gt;
Lets create a Make file in &lt;code&gt;mojo_react_app/Makefile&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight make"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;DOCKER_TAG&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;?=&lt;/span&gt; mojo_react_app:development
&lt;span class="nv"&gt;NO_CACHE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;?=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nv"&gt;PULL&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;?=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nv"&gt;BUILD_TYPE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;?=&lt;/span&gt; development
&lt;span class="nv"&gt;CONTAINER_NAME&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;?=&lt;/span&gt; mojo_react_app
&lt;span class="nv"&gt;HTTPS_OUT_PORT&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;?=&lt;/span&gt; 443
&lt;span class="nv"&gt;HTTPS_IN_PORT&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;?=&lt;/span&gt; 443
&lt;span class="nv"&gt;HTTP_OUT_PORT&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;?=&lt;/span&gt; 80
&lt;span class="nv"&gt;HTTP_IN_PORT&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;?=&lt;/span&gt; 80
&lt;span class="nv"&gt;DOCKER_REPO&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;?=&lt;/span&gt; &amp;lt;docker_repo_url&amp;gt;

    &lt;span class="p"&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'  build      build docker --image--'&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'  rebuild    rebuild docker --image--'&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'  dev        run docker --container-- in development mode =&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$(DOCKER_TAG)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'  stag       run docker --container-- in staging mode'&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'  prod       run docker --container-- in production mode'&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'  login      run as service and login --container--'&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'  clean_image        remove docker --image-- '&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;''&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'Extra arguments:'&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'CONTAINER_NAME=:     make clean_container -e CONTAINER_NAME=my_app (no need to provide this param, it will be set by default)'&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'BUILD_TYPE=:     make clean_container -e CONTAINER_NAME=my_app BUILD_TYPE=staging (whether the build type is '&lt;/span&gt;development&lt;span class="s1"&gt;', '&lt;/span&gt;staging&lt;span class="s1"&gt;' or '&lt;/span&gt;production&lt;span class="s1"&gt;')'&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'DOCKER_TAG=:     make build -e DOCKER_TAG=my_app:staging'&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'HTTPS_OUT_PORT=:     make create -e HTTPS_IN_PORT=8080 (port from which the request will come- outside world)'&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'HTTPS_IN_PORT=:      make create -e HTTPS_IN_PORT=443 (port to which the request will be forwarded)'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I know its overwhelming. Lets go through each one of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Initial 12 lines are the default parameters. In case you will not provide any parameter it will take those arguments. By default everything is in &lt;code&gt;development&lt;/code&gt; mode. You will have to overwrite it for different modes.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;DOCKER_TAG     =&amp;gt;  Name of your app with the env name (e.g. mojo_react_app:development)
NO_CACHE       =&amp;gt;  Whether to start the build from scratch (true|false). Default - false
PULL           =&amp;gt;  Whether to pull a newer version of the image (true|false). Default - false
BUILD_TYPE     =&amp;gt;  Build environment (development|staging|production). Default - development
CONTAINER_NAME =&amp;gt;  Name of the container (e.g. mojo_react_app)
HTTPS_OUT_PORT =&amp;gt;  HTTPS host port visible to outside world while publishing the container(443)
HTTPS_IN_PORT  =&amp;gt;  HTTPS container port on which traffic will be coming inside the container(443)
HTTP_OUT_PORT  =&amp;gt;  HTTP host port visible to outside world while publishing the container(80)
HTTP_IN_PORT   =&amp;gt;  HTTP container port on which traffic will be coming inside the container(80)
DOCKER_REPO    =&amp;gt;  URL of the docker repo where you want to push or pull image.
ADDRESS        =&amp;gt;  IP address of the container from where the outside word can access it. Default - 0.0.0.0
DOCKER_CFG     =?  Path to docker config files on host machine. This will contain the apache certificate and will be private to you.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;build&lt;/code&gt; will build your dockerfile&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;create&lt;/code&gt; will create the container and copy the apache certificates&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;start&lt;/code&gt; will start the container&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;run&lt;/code&gt; will create and start the container. It will internally call the &lt;code&gt;create&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;start&lt;/code&gt; command.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;stop&lt;/code&gt; will stop the running container.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;clean_container&lt;/code&gt; will remove/delete the remove previous container if exist.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;clean_image&lt;/code&gt; will remove/delete created image if exist.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;show&lt;/code&gt; will show the info about running container.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;rebuild&lt;/code&gt; will rebuilt the dockerfile. It will just call &lt;code&gt;clean_container&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;build&lt;/code&gt; the image again.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;up&lt;/code&gt; will run the container on given port. It will always pull  the new image.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;login&lt;/code&gt; will login to the container. Using this you can see the  traffic logs and what is going on inside the container.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;release&lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt;push&lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt;pull&lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt;tag&lt;/code&gt; - These commands you will be using when you want to create tag and push it to docker repo url(somewhere where you can access it and you don't have to create the image again). This is handful in Jenkins deployments, otherwise in normal dev work its not that important and will not be used much.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;help&lt;/code&gt; will give you the info about different param and what they do.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Now 3 important commands which we will be using more often is -
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;    make dev
    make stag
    make prod
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#make-dev"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  make dev
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;dev&lt;/code&gt; is written in such a way that you don't have to worry about your container name and param. Just update the default value with your project specific value one time and your dev environment will be ready in no time.&lt;br&gt;
It will build the container, create it and run it with single command.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;make dev
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Run this command.&lt;br&gt;
Here are the screenshot at different point of time for this command. For the first time this command will take few minutes but subsequent run will be completed within few seconds.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--pEf7xN68--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rai-gaurav/mojo_react_app/main/with_jsx/server/output_screenshot/make_dev.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--pEf7xN68--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rai-gaurav/mojo_react_app/main/with_jsx/server/output_screenshot/make_dev.png" alt="make_dev"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s---PwTLAcM--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rai-gaurav/mojo_react_app/main/with_jsx/server/output_screenshot/Mojo_installation.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s---PwTLAcM--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rai-gaurav/mojo_react_app/main/with_jsx/server/output_screenshot/Mojo_installation.png" alt="mojo_installation"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--_Y3rwP-Y--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rai-gaurav/mojo_react_app/main/with_jsx/server/output_screenshot/container_up.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--_Y3rwP-Y--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rai-gaurav/mojo_react_app/main/with_jsx/server/output_screenshot/container_up.png" alt="container_up"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I have highlighted different section for better understanding.&lt;br&gt;
You can access your app on &lt;a href="https://localhost/"&gt;https://localhost/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--fuBsDcBl--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rai-gaurav/mojo_react_app/main/with_jsx/server/output_screenshot/HomePage.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--fuBsDcBl--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rai-gaurav/mojo_react_app/main/with_jsx/server/output_screenshot/HomePage.png" alt="HomePage"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#make-stag"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  make stag
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This command you will be running when you want to deploy your application in staging environment.&lt;br&gt;
If you look closely we are overriding the default config for staging in initial few lines.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight make"&gt;&lt;code&gt;    &lt;span class="err"&gt;$(eval&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;override&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;BUILD_TYPE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;staging&lt;span class="o"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;$(eval override DOCKER_TAG=${CONTAINER_NAME}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;${BUILD_TYPE})&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="c"&gt;# This will return only the IP address associated with the domain name ans assign it to ADDRESS&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nf"&gt;$(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;eval&lt;/span&gt; override &lt;span class="nv"&gt;ADDRESS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;$(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;shell&lt;/span&gt; dig +short &amp;lt;your staging URL e.g. mojo-react-app-staging.com&amp;gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The 4th lines is where you have to make your changes as per your requirement. We are overriding the default value of address(0.0.0.0) with your domain name of staging environment. We are using the &lt;code&gt;dig&lt;/code&gt; utility to generate the IP address from that domain name and assigning it to ADDRESS.&lt;br&gt;
Just run&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;make stag
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;and you can access your staging environment.&lt;br&gt;
E.g. &lt;br&gt;
      &lt;a href="https://mojo-react-app-staging.com/"&gt;https://mojo-react-app-staging.com/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;or&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
      &lt;a href="https://staging-ip-add/"&gt;https://staging-ip-add/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#make-prod"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  make prod
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This command you will be running when you want to deploy your application in production environment.&lt;br&gt;
Again, you can see we are overriding the default config for production in initial few lines.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight make"&gt;&lt;code&gt;    &lt;span class="err"&gt;$(eval&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;override&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;BUILD_TYPE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;production&lt;span class="o"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;$(eval override DOCKER_TAG = ${CONTAINER_NAME}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;${BUILD_TYPE})&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="c"&gt;# This will return only the IP address associated with the domain name ans assign it to ADDRESS&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nf"&gt;$(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;eval&lt;/span&gt; override &lt;span class="nv"&gt;ADDRESS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;$(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;shell&lt;/span&gt; dig +short &amp;lt;your production URL e.g. mojo-react-app.com&lt;span class="nf"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Here again in 4th lines is where you have to make your changes as per your requirement. Update it to your prod environment hostname. We are using the &lt;code&gt;dig&lt;/code&gt; utility to generate the IP address from that domain name and assigning it to ADDRESS.&lt;br&gt;
Just run&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;make prod
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;and you can access your staging environment.&lt;br&gt;
E.g. &lt;br&gt;
      &lt;a href="https://mojo-react-app.com/"&gt;https://mojo-react-app.com/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;or&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
      &lt;a href="https://production-ip-add/"&gt;https://production-ip-add/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#stop-the-container"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Stop the container
&lt;/h1&gt;



&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;make stop
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;By default it will stop the dev container. Pass different param for stag or prod env.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#login-to-container"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Login to container
&lt;/h1&gt;



&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;make login
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Again it will login to dev one by default. You can pass param to override that behavior.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--7di2ioyf--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rai-gaurav/mojo_react_app/main/with_jsx/server/output_screenshot/make_login.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--7di2ioyf--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rai-gaurav/mojo_react_app/main/with_jsx/server/output_screenshot/make_login.png" alt="LoginContainer"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#conclusion"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Conclusion
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This Makefile is just a wrapper around different docker commands.&lt;br&gt;
Especially during development you can enable live reload and your changes in host will be available in docker container also . More info &lt;a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-enable-live-reload-on-docker-based-applications/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
You can use it for any Dockerfile. Here I am using a Mojolicious application. But the same Makefile can be used for a Django application or any other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope this is useful for you and make your life more smoother.&lt;br&gt;
The Makefile is also available on &lt;a href="https://github.com/rai-gaurav/mojo_react_app/tree/main/with_jsx/server/mojo_react_app"&gt;github&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Disk space usage of CPAN authors (May 16, 2021 edition)</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://perlancar.wordpress.com/2021/05/16/disk-space-usage-of-cpan-authors-may-16-2021-edition/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Prompted by &lt;a href="http://neilb.org/2021/05/10/delete-your-old-releases.html"&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt; on PAUSE running out of disk space, I thought I&amp;#039;d refresh my own post &amp;quot;&lt;a href="https://perlancar.wordpress.com/2019/12/26/top-50-authors-by-disk-space-on-backpan/"&gt;Top 50 authors by disk space on BackPAN&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt; (Dec 26, 2019) and add a stat for CPAN too. Hopefully this will be a regular post, ish. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;On CPAN&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Source: &lt;a href="https://www.cpan.org/indices/find-ls.gz" rel="nofollow"&gt;https://www.cpan.org/indices/find-ls.gz&lt;/a&gt; (~14MB as of this writing), but more readily used: &lt;a href="https://www.cpan.org/indices/du-k.gz" rel="nofollow"&gt;https://www.cpan.org/indices/du-k.gz&lt;/a&gt; (~80KB as of this writing). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Total size of CPAN: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;pre class="fixed_width_section"&gt;% zcat du-k.gz | perl -lne&amp;#039;@F=split /\s+/, $_, 2; $F[1] eq &amp;quot;.&amp;quot; and printf &amp;quot;%.1fGB\n&amp;quot;, $F[0]/1024/1024 and last&amp;#039;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre class="fixed_width_section"&gt;29.0GB
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt; So, CPAN is not that big by today&amp;#039;s standards and I would guess that it&amp;#039;s growing at a relatively regular pace. Also the first post does not give details on the spec of PAUSE&amp;#039;s server nor the exact thing that caused the disk to be full, but anyway. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Total size of &lt;tt&gt;authors/id/&lt;/tt&gt; directory: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;pre class="fixed_width_section"&gt;% zcat du-k.gz | perl -lne&amp;#039;@F=split /\s+/, $_, 2; $F[1] eq &amp;quot;./authors/id&amp;quot; and printf &amp;quot;%.1fGB\n&amp;quot;, $F[0]/1024/1024 and last&amp;#039;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre class="fixed_width_section"&gt;28.0GB
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Not much surprise here. The &lt;tt&gt;authors/id/&lt;/tt&gt; directory is where CPAN authors upload to.

&lt;p&gt; Some authors have mentioned that they would like to have their old releases purged from BackPAN as well, but from what I see so far this does not seem to have happened yet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also if you see, some authors have not done much purging. I remember someone produced percentage number of an individual author&amp;#039;s CPAN/BackPAN usage as a measure of &amp;quot;cleanup&amp;quot;, but can&amp;#039;t remember who and where.&lt;/p&gt;

        <![CDATA[<p>In this weeks <a href="https://www.perlfoundation.org/marketing-committee.html">TPF Marketing Committee</a> meeting I made an elevator pitch for a "Perl Community Dashboard". It was well received so I have taken the action item to expound upon the idea here to gather more input. Understand this then as the minimum viable product to go from 0 to 1, something achievable that we can build upon.</p>

<p><strong>The Goal:</strong> </p>

<p>Create a central web based "Dashboard" (think Grafana-ish) the brings together metrics from key Perl related websites (hereafter, mastheads) and potentially other channels such as social media or irc. </p>

<p><strong>What is the "Business Outcome"?</strong></p>

<p>The marketing committee can use those metrics to set goals and measure the effectiveness of marketing activities. By including many mastheads we can get a picture of activity levels over time, how people move between the content, and which content is the most important. </p>

<p>Being able to dive & explore this data will also be valuable to the marketing committee and to other TPF committees. This could guide everything from blog posts, to conference talks, to book ideas, to training classes.</p>

<p><strong>What would be included:</strong></p>

<p>Acknowledging many of these are not "owned" by TPF, the mastheads I want to be included initially would include:</p>

<ul>
	<li>perlfoundation.org</li>
	<li>news.perlfoundation.org</li>
       <li>perl.com</li>
	<li>perl.org</li>
	<li>blogs.perl.org</li>
	<li>jobs.perl.org</li>
        <li>perldoc.perl.org</li>
	<li>metacpan.org</li>
	<li>cpan.org</li>
        <li>rt.cpan.org</li>
       <li>perlconference.us</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>What is needed from each website?</strong></p>

<p>Initially this would just be a javascript snippet to instruct web browsers to send the various metric data. </p>

<p>More detailed analytics could later be added, for example I am very interested to learn more about what people are searching for and downloading from (meta)cpan.</p>

<p>This is far less complicated and gives richer data than shipping http access logs.</p>

<p><strong>What analytics platform would we use?</strong></p>

<p>We should use something off the shelf, ideally something SaaS so we don't have the overheads of running the infrastructure. The downside of someone else's cloud analytics platform is there may be resistance to it, compared to self hosting the data.</p>

<p>Without getting lost entirely in selecting a solution, a brief taxonomy of key products:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Adobe Marketing Cloud (once Omniture) is the market leader and is consumed as a cloud SaaS product. Adobe offers discounts for 501c3's like TPF (YAS) although pricing isn't public</li>
<li>Matomo (was Piwik) is a very capable FOSS alternative with a Freemium business model that offers both cloud and self hosting. Paid add-on features add up quickly compared to the nominal fee for their cloud offering.</li>
<li>Others that community members suggest in the comments</li>
</ul>

<p>Adobe as the market leader would allow us to most easily engage someone to assist, I can't find modules in CPAN for it and having used it in past $work we just used our own client API.</p>

<p>Matomo has modules on CPAN and some of them look recent.</p>

<p>No matter what we select, hopefully we can help create, publish, and enhance the client API modules for the various Perl frameworks.</p>

<p><strong>Prior Art?</strong></p>

<p>I have not seen any other FOSS project or foundation do something similar, though no doubt they use Google Analytics.</p>

<p><br />
<strong>Pre-emptively addressing concerns</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li><em>I don't like tracking people.</em> You should use browser features or plugins to block it, as you would on other websites.</li>
        <li><em>You should just use access logs.</em> Shipping access logs is far more complicated and gives very few details, referrers especially are removed by search engines.</li>
        <li><em>Privacy Concerns.</em> Using an existing platform with GDPR already sorted is a good start. We absolutely must respect peoples privacy</li>
        <li><em>This is pointless.</em> Hopefully people can see that having metrics to measure the outcomes of marketing activities is of benefit. A reward of all work (paid or volunteer) is being able to see clearly that we (you) did something and people responded positively - let's provide that.</li>
<li><em>Platform X is stupid, use platform Y.</em> Please note your preferred products in the comments, it would be great to learn more</li>
<li><em>This is great! I want to get involved!</em> Let us know in the comments or contact the <a href="mailto:hello@perlfoundation.org">marketing committee</a></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Whats next?</strong></p>

<p>For me is sharing this pitch with more people in the community and fleshing it out in to a proposal - So please share your thoughts in the comments.</p>

<p>I am very interested in your experiences with different platforms and successes you have had using them with the various Perl frameworks.</p>

<p>It is my hope that many people will be able to build on this work in many directions.</p>]]>

        <![CDATA[<p>These are some answers to the Week 112 of the <a href="https://perlweeklychallenge.org/blog/perl-weekly-challenge-112/">Perl Weekly Challenge</a> organized by <a href="http://blogs.perl.org/users/mohammad_s_anwar/">Mohammad S. Anwar</a>.</p>

<p><em>Spoiler Alert:</em> This weekly challenge deadline is due in a few  days (May 16, 2021). This blog post offers some solutions to this challenge, please don’t read on if you intend to complete the challenge on your own.</p>

<h2>Task 1: Canonical Path</h2>

<p><em>You are given a string path, starting with a slash ‘/&#8217;.</em></p>

<p><em>Write a script to convert the given absolute path to the simplified canonical path.</em></p>

<p><em>In a Unix-style file system:</em></p>

<p><em>- A period &#8216;.&#8217; refers to the current directory</em></p>

<p><em>- A double period &#8216;..&#8217; refers to the directory up a level</em></p>

<p><em>- Multiple consecutive slashes (&#8216;//&#8217;) are treated as a single slash &#8216;/&#8217;</em></p>

<p><em>The canonical path format:</em></p>

<p><em>- The path starts with a single slash &#8216;/&#8217;.</em></p>

<p><em>- Any two directories are separated by a single slash &#8216;/&#8217;.</em></p>

<p><em>- The path does not end with a trailing &#8216;/&#8217;.</em></p>

<p><em>- The path only contains the directories on the path from the root directory to the target file or directory</em></p>

<p><em>Example:</em></p>

<pre><code>Input: "/a/"
Output: "/a"

Input: "/a/b//c/"
Output: "/a/b/c"

Input: "/a/b/c/../.."
Output: "/a"
</code></pre>

<p>Although it can surely be done differently, this is obviously a job for regular expressions or regexes.</p>

<h3>Canonical Path in Raku</h3>

<p>It would certainly make sense to write a grammar for performing the necessary transformations, but this is simple enough for a few regexes to do the job. It is in fact probably possible to do everything with a single regex, but I usually find it more legible to transform the input string step by step. </p>

<p>Note that I&#8217;m not trying to validate the input paths, with just one exception: if there are too many <code>/../</code> compared to the previous path items, the script dies, rather than printing something incorrect.</p>

<pre><code>use v6

my @tests = &lt;/a/ /a/b//c/ /a/b/c/../.. /a/../../b/&gt;;
for @tests &lt;-&gt; $path {
    my $p = $path;
    $path ~~ s:g|'//'+|/|;
    $path ~~ s:g!^'/' | '/'$!!;
    my @path-items;
    for split /'/'+/, $path -&gt; $item {
        next if $item eq '.';
        if $item eq '..' {
            die "Invalid path $p" unless @path-items;
            pop @path-items;
        } else {
            push @path-items, $item;
        }
    };
    say "$p =&gt; /", @path-items.join('/');
}
</code></pre>

<p>The script displays the following output:</p>

<pre><code>$ raku ./paths.raku
/a/ =&gt; /a
/a/b//c/ =&gt; /a/b/c
/a/b/c/../.. =&gt; /a
Invalid path /a/../../b/
  in block  at ./main.raku line 12
  in block &lt;unit&gt; at ./main.raku line 4
</code></pre>

<h3>Canonical Path in Perl</h3>

<p>This a port to Perl of the Raku program above, except that when there are too many <code>/../</code> compared to the previous path items, the script issues a warning instead of dying, does not print any canonical path and proceeds with the next items.</p>

<pre><code>use strict;
use warnings;
use feature "say";

my @tests = ('/a/', '/a/b//c/', '/a/b/c/../..', '/a/../../b/', '/a/././b/');
TEST: for my $path (@tests) {
    my $p = $path;
    $path =~ s|\/\/+|/|g;
    $path =~ s!^\/|\/$!!g;
    my @path_items;
    for my $item (split /\/+/, $path) {
        next if $item eq '.';
        if ($item eq '..') {
            warn "Invalid path $p" and next TEST unless @path_items;
            pop @path_items;
        } else {
            push @path_items, $item;
        }
    };
    say "$p =&gt; /", join '/', @path_items;
}
</code></pre>

<p>The script displays the following output:</p>

<pre><code>$ perl paths.pl
/a/ =&gt; /a
/a/b//c/ =&gt; /a/b/c
/a/b/c/../.. =&gt; /a
Invalid path /a/../../b/ at paths.pl line 14.
/a/././b/ =&gt; /a/b
</code></pre>

<h2>Task 2: Climb Stairs</h2>

<p><em>You are given <code>$n</code> steps to climb.</em></p>

<p><em>Write a script to find out the distinct ways to climb to the top. You are allowed to climb either 1 or 2 steps at a time.</em></p>

<p><em>Example:</em></p>

<pre><code>Input: $n = 3
Output: 3

    Option 1: 1 step + 1 step + 1 step
    Option 2: 1 step + 2 steps
    Option 3: 2 steps + 1 step

Input: $n = 4
Output: 5

    Option 1: 1 step + 1 step + 1 step + 1 step
    Option 2: 1 step + 1 step + 2 steps
    Option 3: 2 steps + 1 step + 1 step
    Option 4: 1 step + 2 steps + 1 step
    Option 5: 2 steps + 2 steps
</code></pre>

<p>It is not clear to me whether the output should contain all the information above, or just the number of possibilities, but since the assignment asks us &#8220;to find out the distinct ways to climb to the top&#8221;, I have decided to output the result in the format given above, although this leads to quite a bit of uninteresting boiler plate code.</p>

<h3>Climb Stairs in Raku</h3>

<p>I&#8217;ve decided to use a <code>try-steps</code> recursive subroutine to explore all possibilities. The script uses a <code>@*result</code> dynamic variable to store the various winning combinations of steps and to print them at the end. </p>

<pre><code>use v6;

sub print-result {
    my $count = 0;  
    for  @*result -&gt; @solution {
        print "\tOption ", ++$count, ": ";
        my @step_list;
        push @step_list, "$_ " ~ ($_ ~~ /1/ ?? "step " !! "steps") for @solution;
        say join " + ", @step_list;
    }
    say "";
}

sub try-steps ($nb-steps, @curr) {
    for 1, 2 -&gt; $new-step {
        my @new-cur = (|@curr, $new-step);
        my $sum = [+] @new-cur;
        next if $sum &gt; $nb-steps;
        if $sum == $nb-steps {
            push @*result, @new-cur;
            last;
        } else {
            try-steps $nb-steps, @new-cur;
        }
    }
}

for 3, 4, 5 -&gt; $target {
    my @*result;
    try-steps $target, [];
    say 'Input: $n = ', $target;
    say "Output: ", @*result.elems;
    # say @*result;
    print-result;
}
</code></pre>

<p>The script displays the following output:</p>

<pre><code>$ raku ./steps.raku
Input: $n = 3
Output: 3
    Option 1: 1 step  + 1 step  + 1 step 
    Option 2: 1 step  + 2 steps
    Option 3: 2 steps + 1 step 

Input: $n = 4
Output: 5
    Option 1: 1 step  + 1 step  + 1 step  + 1 step 
    Option 2: 1 step  + 1 step  + 2 steps
    Option 3: 1 step  + 2 steps + 1 step 
    Option 4: 2 steps + 1 step  + 1 step 
    Option 5: 2 steps + 2 steps

Input: $n = 5
Output: 8
    Option 1: 1 step  + 1 step  + 1 step  + 1 step  + 1 step 
    Option 2: 1 step  + 1 step  + 1 step  + 2 steps
    Option 3: 1 step  + 1 step  + 2 steps + 1 step 
    Option 4: 1 step  + 2 steps + 1 step  + 1 step 
    Option 5: 1 step  + 2 steps + 2 steps
    Option 6: 2 steps + 1 step  + 1 step  + 1 step 
    Option 7: 2 steps + 1 step  + 2 steps
    Option 8: 2 steps + 2 steps + 1 step
</code></pre>

<p>Note that, if you don&#8217;t want this verbose output, you can just remove the <code>print-result</code> subroutine definition, comment out the last line (with the <code>print-result</code> subroutine call), and uncomment the previous code line:</p>

<pre><code>    say @*result;
    # print-result;
</code></pre>

<p>and obtain the following output:</p>

<pre><code>$ raku ./steps.raku
Input: $n = 3
Output: 3
[[1 1 1] [1 2] [2 1]]
Input: $n = 4
Output: 5
[[1 1 1 1] [1 1 2] [1 2 1] [2 1 1] [2 2]]
Input: $n = 5
Output: 8
[[1 1 1 1 1] [1 1 1 2] [1 1 2 1] [1 2 1 1] [1 2 2] [2 1 1 1] [2 1 2] [2 2 1]]
</code></pre>

<h3>Climb Stairs in Perl</h3>

<p>This is a port to Perl of the above Raku program, with a <code>try_steps</code> recursive subroutine:</p>

<pre><code>use strict;
use warnings;
use feature "say";

my @result;

sub print_result {
    my $count = 0;
    for  my $solution (@result) {
        print "\tOption ", ++$count, ": ";
        my @step_list;
        push @step_list, "$_ " . ($_ =~ /1/ ? "step " : "steps") for @$solution;
        say join " + ", @step_list;
    }
    say "";
}

sub try_steps  {
    my ($nb_steps, $sum, @curr) = @_;
    for my $new_step (1, 2) {
        my $new_sum =  $sum + $new_step;
        next if $new_sum &gt; $nb_steps;
        my @new_cur = (@curr, $new_step);
        if ($new_sum == $nb_steps) {
            push @result, \@new_cur;
            last;
        } else {
            try_steps($nb_steps, $new_sum, @new_cur);
        }
    }
}

for my $target (3, 4, 5) {
    @result = ();
    try_steps $target, 0, ();
    say 'Input: $n = ', $target;
    say "Output: ", scalar @result;
    print_result;
}
</code></pre>

<p>This script displays the following output:</p>

<pre><code>$ perl  ./steps.pl
Input: $n = 3

        Option 1: 1 step  + 1 step  + 1 step

    <title>Perl / Unix One-liner Cage Match, Part 1</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://perl.com/article/perl-one-liners-part-1/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A shell (like Bash) provides built-in commands and scripting features to easily solve and automate various tasks. External commands like grep, sed, Awk, sort, find, or parallel can be combined to work with each other. Sometimes you can use Perl either as a single replacement or a complement to them for specific use cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perl is the most robust portable option for text processing needs. Perl has a feature rich regular expression engine, built-in functions, an extensive ecosystem, and is quite portable. However, Perl may have slower performance compared to specialized tools and can be more verbose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="one-liners-or-scripts"&gt;One-liners or scripts?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For assembly-level testing of a digital signal processing (DSP) chip, I had to replicate the same scenario for multiple address ranges. My working knowledge of Linux command line was limited at that time and I didn&amp;rsquo;t know how to use sed or Awk. I used Vim and Perl for all sorts of text processing needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;rsquo;t know about Perl&amp;rsquo;s options for one-liners, so I used to modify a script whenever I had to do substitutions for multiple files. Once, I even opened the files as Vim buffers and applied a &lt;code&gt;bufdo&lt;/code&gt; command to see if that would make my workflow simpler. If I had known about Perl one-liners, I could have easily utilized find and Bash globs to make my life easier, for example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"&gt;&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"&gt;$ perl -i -pe &lt;span style="color:#e6db74"&gt;&amp;#39;s/0xABCD;/0x1234;/; s/0xDEAD;/0xBEEF;/&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt; *.tests&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;-i&lt;/code&gt; option will write back the changes to the source files. If needed, I can pass an argument to create a backup of the original files. For example, &lt;code&gt;-i.bkp&lt;/code&gt; will create &lt;em&gt;ip.txt.bkp&lt;/em&gt; as the backup for &lt;em&gt;ip.txt&lt;/em&gt; passed as the input file. I can also put the backups in another existing directory. The &lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt; gets expanded to original filename:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"&gt;&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"&gt;$ mkdir backups
$ perl -i&lt;span style="color:#e6db74"&gt;&amp;#39;backups/*&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt; -pe &lt;span style="color:#e6db74"&gt;&amp;#39;s/SEARCH/REPLACE/g&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt; *.txt&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="powerful-regexp-features"&gt;Powerful regexp features&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perl regexps are much more powerful than either basic or extended regular expressions used by utilities. The common features I often use are non-greedy and possessive quantifiers, lookarounds, the &lt;code&gt;/e&lt;/code&gt; flag, subexpression calls, and &lt;code&gt;(*SKIP)(*FAIL)&lt;/code&gt;. Here are some examples from StackOverflow threads that I have answered over the years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="skip-some-matches"&gt;Skip some matches&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This question needed &lt;a href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/64368280/4082052"&gt;to convert avr-asm to arm-gnu comments&lt;/a&gt;. The starting file looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"&gt;&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"&gt;ABC r1,&lt;span style="color:#e6db74"&gt;&amp;#39;;&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
ABC r1,&lt;span style="color:#e6db74"&gt;&amp;#34;;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt; ; comment
  ;;;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I need to change &lt;code&gt;;&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;@&lt;/code&gt;, but &lt;code&gt;;&lt;/code&gt; within single or double quotes shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be affected. I can match quoted &lt;code&gt;;&lt;/code&gt; in the first branch of the alternation and use &lt;code&gt;(*SKIP)(*F)&lt;/code&gt; to not replace those:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"&gt;&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"&gt;$ perl -pe &lt;span style="color:#e6db74"&gt;&amp;#39;s/(?:\x27;\x27|&amp;#34;;&amp;#34;)(*SKIP)(*F)|;/@/&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt; ip.txt
ABC r1,&lt;span style="color:#e6db74"&gt;&amp;#39;;&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
ABC r1,&lt;span style="color:#e6db74"&gt;&amp;#34;;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt; @ comment
  @;;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I use &lt;code&gt;(*SKIP)(*F)&lt;/code&gt; so often that I wish it had a shorter syntax, &lt;code&gt;(*SF)&lt;/code&gt; for example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="replace-a-string-with-an-incrementing-value"&gt;Replace a string with an incrementing value&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can &lt;a href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/42554684/4082052"&gt;replace strings with incrementing value&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;code&gt;/e&lt;/code&gt; on a substitution allows me to treat the replacement side as Perl code. Whatever that code evaluates to is the replacement. That can be a variable that I increment:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"&gt;&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"&gt;$ echo &lt;span style="color:#e6db74"&gt;&amp;#39;a | a | a | a | a | a | a | a&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt; | perl -pe &lt;span style="color:#e6db74"&gt;&amp;#39;s/ *\| */$i++/ge&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
a0a1a2a3a4a5a6a&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="reverse-a-substring"&gt;Reverse a substring&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also used the &lt;code&gt;/e&lt;/code&gt; trick &lt;a href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/63681983/4082052"&gt;to reverse the text matched by a pattern&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"&gt;&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"&gt;$ echo &lt;span style="color:#e6db74"&gt;&amp;#39;romarana789:qwerty12543&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt; | perl -pe &lt;span style="color:#e6db74"&gt;&amp;#39;s/\d+$/reverse $&amp;amp;/e&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
romarana789:qwerty34521&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="do-some-arithmetic"&gt;Do some arithmetic&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adding another &lt;code&gt;/e&lt;/code&gt; to get &lt;code&gt;/ee&lt;/code&gt; means there are two rounds of Perl code. I evaluate the replacement side to get the string that I&amp;rsquo;ll evaluate as Perl code. In &lt;a href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/62241101/4082052"&gt;Arithmetic replacement in a text file&lt;/a&gt;, I need to find simple arithmetic, like &lt;code&gt;25100+10&lt;/code&gt;, and replace that with its arithmetic result:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"&gt;&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"&gt;id&lt;span style="color:#f92672"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ae81ff"&gt;25100&lt;/span&gt;+10
xyz&lt;span style="color:#f92672"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ae81ff"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;+
abc&lt;span style="color:#f92672"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ae81ff"&gt;123456&lt;/span&gt;
conf_string&lt;span style="color:#f92672"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;LMN,J,IP,25100+1,0,3,1&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can do that with one &lt;code&gt;/e&lt;/code&gt; by matching the numbers and doing some Perl on the replacement side:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"&gt;&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"&gt;$ perl -pe &lt;span style="color:#e6db74"&gt;&amp;#39;s/(\d+)\+(\d+)/$1+$2/ge&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt; ip.txt
id&lt;span style="color:#f92672"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ae81ff"&gt;25110&lt;/span&gt;
xyz&lt;span style="color:#f92672"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ae81ff"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;+
abc&lt;span style="color:#f92672"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ae81ff"&gt;123456&lt;/span&gt;
conf_string&lt;span style="color:#f92672"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;LMN,J,IP,25101,0,3,1&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But instead of matching the numbers separately, I can match the whole expression. The match is in &lt;code&gt;$&amp;amp;&lt;/code&gt;, so the first &lt;code&gt;/e&lt;/code&gt; interpolates that to &lt;code&gt;25100+10&lt;/code&gt;. The second round runs that as Perl, which is addition:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"&gt;&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"&gt;$ perl -pe &lt;span style="color:#e6db74"&gt;&amp;#39;s/\d+\+\d+/$&amp;amp;/gee&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt; ip.txt
id&lt;span style="color:#f92672"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ae81ff"&gt;25110&lt;/span&gt;
xyz&lt;span style="color:#f92672"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ae81ff"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;+
abc&lt;span style="color:#f92672"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ae81ff"&gt;123456&lt;/span&gt;
conf_string&lt;span style="color:#f92672"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;LMN,J,IP,25101,0,3,1&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That would also make it easier to handle a set of operators:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"&gt;&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"&gt;$ echo &lt;span style="color:#e6db74"&gt;&amp;#39;2+3 10-3 8*8 11/5&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt; | perl -pe &lt;span style="color:#e6db74"&gt;&amp;#39;s|\d+[+/*-]\d+|$&amp;amp;|gee&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span style="color:#ae81ff"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color:#ae81ff"&gt;7&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color:#ae81ff"&gt;64&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color:#ae81ff"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;.2&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="handling-the-newline"&gt;Handling the newline&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to un-hypenate this text:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"&gt;&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"&gt;Hello there.
It will rain to-
day. Have a safe
and pleasant jou-
rney.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike sed and Awk, you can choose to preserve the record separator in Perl. That makes it easier to solve this problem:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"&gt;&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"&gt;$ perl -pe &lt;span style="color:#e6db74"&gt;&amp;#39;s/-\n//&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt; msg.txt
Hello there.
It will rain today. Have a safe
and pleasant journey.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See &lt;a href="https://unix.stackexchange.com/q/647648/109046"&gt;remove dashes and replace newlines with spaces&lt;/a&gt; for a similar problem and to compare the Perl solution with sed/Awk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="multiline-fixed-string-substitution"&gt;Multiline fixed-string substitution&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Escaping regexp metacharacters is simpler with built-in features in Perl. Combined with slurping entire input file as a single string, I can easily perform multiline fixed-string substitutions. Consider this sample input:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"&gt;&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"&gt;This is a multiline
sample input with lots
of special characters
like . &lt;span style="color:#f92672"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; * &lt;span style="color:#f92672"&gt;[]&lt;/span&gt; $ &lt;span style="color:#f92672"&gt;{}&lt;/span&gt;
^ + ? &lt;span style="color:#ae81ff"&gt;\ &lt;/span&gt;and &lt;span style="color:#960050;background-color:#1e0010"&gt;&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt; and so on.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Say you have a file containing the lines you wish to match:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"&gt;&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"&gt;like . &lt;span style="color:#f92672"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; * &lt;span style="color:#f92672"&gt;[]&lt;/span&gt; $ &lt;span style="color:#f92672"&gt;{}&lt;/span&gt;
^ + ? &lt;span style="color:#ae81ff"&gt;\ &lt;/span&gt;and &lt;span style="color:#960050;background-color:#1e0010"&gt;&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt; and so on.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And a file containing the replacement string:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"&gt;&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"&gt;---------------------
$&amp;amp; &lt;span style="color:#f92672"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; $1 + $2 / &lt;span style="color:#ae81ff"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color:#ae81ff"&gt;\ &lt;/span&gt;4
&lt;span style="color:#f92672"&gt;=====================&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s one way to do it with Perl:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"&gt;&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"&gt;$ perl -0777 -ne &lt;span style="color:#e6db74"&gt;&amp;#39;$#ARGV==1 ? $s=$_ : $#ARGV==0 ? $r=$_ :
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:#e6db74"&gt;                  print s/\Q$s/$r/gr&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt; search.txt replace.txt ip.txt
This is a multiline
sample input with lots
of special characters
---------------------
$&amp;amp; &lt;span style="color:#f92672"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; $1 + $2 / &lt;span style="color:#ae81ff"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color:#ae81ff"&gt;\ &lt;/span&gt;4
&lt;span style="color:#f92672"&gt;=====================&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that in the above solution, contents of &lt;code&gt;search.txt&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;replace.txt&lt;/code&gt; are also processed by the Perl command. Avoid using shell variables to save their contents, since trailing newlines and ASCII NUL characters will require special attention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Awk and sed do not have an equivalent option to slurp the entire input file content. Sed is Turing complete and Awk is a programming language, so you can write code for it if you wish, in addition to the code you&amp;rsquo;d need for escaping the metacharacters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="better-regexp-support"&gt;Better regexp support&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some other regexp libraries have problems tied to whatever they use to implement them. GNU versions, for example, may have some bugs that other implementations may not have. Which version you use can give different results. Perl, however, has the same bugs everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="back-references"&gt;Back references&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s a &lt;a href="https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=25322"&gt;problem with backreferences in glibc&lt;/a&gt; that I found and &lt;a href="https://debbugs.gnu.org/cgi/bugreport.cgi?bug=26864"&gt;reported for grep&lt;/a&gt;. This bug is seen in at least GNU implementations of grep and sed. As far as I know, no implementation of Awk supports backreferences within regexp definition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wanted to get words having two occurrences of consecutive repeated characters. This example takes some time and results in no output:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"&gt;&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"&gt;$ grep -xiE &lt;span style="color:#e6db74"&gt;&amp;#39;([a-z]*([a-z])\2[a-z]*){2}&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt; /usr/share/dict/words&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It does work when the nesting is unrolled or PCRE is used:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"&gt;&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"&gt;$ grep -xiE &lt;span style="color:#e6db74"&gt;&amp;#39;[a-z]*([a-z])\1[a-z]*([a-z])\2[a-z]*&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt; /usr/share/dict/words
Abbott
Annabelle
...

$ grep -xiP &lt;span style="color:#e6db74"&gt;&amp;#39;([a-z]*([a-z])\2[a-z]*){2}&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt; /usr/share/dict/words
Abbott
Annabelle
...&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s the Perl, which is the original regexp:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"&gt;&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"&gt;$ perl -ne &lt;span style="color:#e6db74"&gt;&amp;#39;print if /^([a-z]*([a-z])\2[a-z]*){2}$/i&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt; /usr/share/dict/words
Abbott
Annabelle
...&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="word-boundaries"&gt;Word boundaries&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://unix.stackexchange.com/q/579889/109046"&gt;Why doesn&amp;rsquo;t this sed command replace the 3rd-to-last &amp;ldquo;and&amp;rdquo;?&lt;/a&gt; shows another interesting bug when word boundaries and group repetition are involved. This bug is seen in anything using the regexp stuff from glibc (as you would on Linux):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This incorrectly matches because there is no word boundary in the middle of &amp;ldquo;cocoa&amp;rdquo;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"&gt;&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"&gt;$ sed --version
sed &lt;span style="color:#f92672"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;GNU sed&lt;span style="color:#f92672"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color:#ae81ff"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;.8
$ echo &lt;span style="color:#e6db74"&gt;&amp;#39;cocoa&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt; | sed -nE &lt;span style="color:#e6db74"&gt;&amp;#39;/(\bco){2}/p&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
cocoa&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without the quantifier, there&amp;rsquo;s no problem and no matches:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"&gt;&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"&gt;$ echo &lt;span style="color:#e6db74"&gt;&amp;#39;cocoa&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt; | sed -nE &lt;span style="color:#e6db74"&gt;&amp;#39;/\bco\bco/p&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
$ echo &lt;span style="color:#e6db74"&gt;&amp;#39;cocoa&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt; | perl -ne &lt;span style="color:#e6db74"&gt;&amp;#39;print if /(\bco){2}/&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s another example from GNU sed. This modifies the line because it thinks it finds &amp;ldquo;it&amp;rdquo; as a separate word two times after &amp;ldquo;with&amp;rdquo;, but the second is really in the middle of &amp;ldquo;sit&amp;rdquo;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"&gt;&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"&gt;$ echo &lt;span style="color:#e6db74"&gt;&amp;#39;it line with it here sit too&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt; | sed -E &lt;span style="color:#e6db74"&gt;&amp;#39;s/with(.*\bit\b){2}/XYZ/&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
it line XYZ too&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Change the pattern to get rid of the quantifier and it works correctly:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"&gt;&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"&gt;$ echo &lt;span style="color:#e6db74"&gt;&amp;#39;it line with it here sit too&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt; | sed -E &lt;span style="color:#e6db74"&gt;&amp;#39;s/with.*\bit\b.*\bit\b/XYZ/&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
it line with it here sit too
$ echo &lt;span style="color:#e6db74"&gt;&amp;#39;it line with it here sit too it a&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt; | sed -E &lt;span style="color:#e6db74"&gt;&amp;#39;s/with.*\bit\b.*\bit\b/XYZ/&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
it line XYZ a

&lt;span style="color:#75715e"&gt;# Perl doesn&amp;#39;t need such workarounds&lt;/span&gt;
$ echo &lt;span style="color:#e6db74"&gt;&amp;#39;it line with it here sit too&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt; | perl -pe &lt;span style="color:#e6db74"&gt;&amp;#39;s/with(.*\bit\b){2}/XYZ/&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
it line with it here sit too
$ echo &lt;span style="color:#e6db74"&gt;&amp;#39;it line with it here sit too it a&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt; | perl -pe &lt;span style="color:#e6db74"&gt;&amp;#39;s/with(.*\bit\b){2}/XYZ/&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
it line XYZ a&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Efficient Matrix Search: The Weekly Challenge 111</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://www.rabbitfarm.com/cgi-bin/blosxom/2021/05/09#pwc111" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The examples used here are from the weekly challenge problem statement and demonstrate the working solution.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="part-1"&gt;Part 1&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You are given 5x5 matrix filled with integers such that each row is sorted from left to right and the first integer of each row is greater than the last integer of the previous row. Write a script to find a given integer in the matrix using an efficient search algorithm.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="solution"&gt;Solution&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="perl"&gt;
use strict;
use warnings;

use boolean;      
use constant MATRIX_SIZE =&gt; 5;   

sub matrix_search{
    my($matrix, $search) = @_;
    unless(@{$matrix} == 1){  
        my $half = int(@{$matrix} / 2);      
        if($matrix-&gt;[$half]-&gt;[0] &gt; $search){
            my @matrix_reduced = @{$matrix}[0 .. $half - 1];
            matrix_search(\@matrix_reduced, $search);    
        }  
        elsif($matrix-&gt;[$half]-&gt;[0] &lt; $search){
            my @matrix_reduced = @{$matrix}[$half .. @{$matrix} - 1];
            matrix_search(\@matrix_reduced, $search);    
        }  
        elsif($matrix-&gt;[$half]-&gt;[0] == $search){
            return true;  
        } 
    }

    }    
}

sub row_search{
    my ($row, $search) = @_; 
    unless(@{$row} == 1){
        my $half = int(@{$row} / 2);  
        if($row-&gt;[$half] &gt; $search){
            my @row_reduced = @{$row}[0 .. $half - 1];
            row_search(\@row_reduced, $search);    
        }  
        elsif($row-&gt;[$half] &lt; $search){
            my @row_reduced = @{$row}[$half .. @{$row} - 1];
            row_search(\@row_reduced, $search);

        }  
    } 
    else{
        return false;
    }   
} 

MAIN:{
    my $N = [[  1,  2,  3,  5,  7 ],  
             [  9, 11, 15, 19, 20 ],   
             [ 23, 24, 25, 29, 31 ],    
             [ 32, 33, 39, 40, 42 ],   
             [ 45, 47, 48, 49, 50 ]];
    my $search = 35;
    print matrix_search($N, $search) . "\n";
    $search = 39;
    print matrix_search($N, $search) . "\n";
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3 id="sample-run"&gt;Sample Run&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="shell"&gt;
$ perl perl/ch-1.pl
0
1
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3 id="notes"&gt;Notes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most efficient way to search through this sorted matrix is with a binary search. Here the binary search is implemented recursively and split into two subroutines. The first search for the right row, the second performs a binary search within the row.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="part-2"&gt;Part 2&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Write a script to find the longest English words that don’t change when their letters are sorted.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="solution-1"&gt;Solution&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="perl"&gt;
use strict;
use warnings;

sub max_sorted{
    my($words) = @_;
    my $max = -1;
    my @length_words; 
    for my $word (@{$words}){
        my $sorted_word = join("", sort { $a cmp $b } split(//, $word));   
        if($word eq $sorted_word &amp;&amp; length($word) &gt;= $max){
            $length_words[length($word)] = [] if(!$length_words[length($word)]); 
            push @{$length_words[length($word)]}, $word;  
            $max = length($word);   
        }   
    }
    return $length_words[$max];  
}

MAIN:{
    my @words;
    while(&lt;&gt;){
        chomp;
        push @words, lc($_);  
    }  
    print join("\n", @{max_sorted(\@words)}) . "\n";    
}

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3 id="sample-run-1"&gt;Sample Run&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="shell"&gt;
$ perl perl/ch-2.pl &lt; /usr/share/dict/words
adelops
alloquy
beefily
begorry
billowy
egilops
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3 id="notes-1"&gt;Notes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This code expects input on STDIN. Here the system dictionary is used. For this file the maximum length of words meeting the criteria is seven. There are six such words, as shown in the output.&lt;/p&gt;

        <![CDATA[<p>These are some answers to the Week 111 of the <a href="https://perlweeklychallenge.org/blog/perl-weekly-challenge-111/">Perl Weekly Challenge</a> organized by <a href="http://blogs.perl.org/users/mohammad_s_anwar/">Mohammad S. Anwar</a>.</p>

<p><em>Spoiler Alert:</em> This weekly challenge deadline is due in a few  days (May 9, 2021). This blog post offers some solutions to this challenge, please don’t read on if you intend to complete the challenge on your own.</p>

<h2>Task 1: Search Matrix</h2>

<p><em>You are given 5x5 matrix filled with integers such that each row is sorted from left to right and the first integer of each row is greater than the last integer of the previous row.</em></p>

<p><em>Write a script to find a given integer in the matrix using an efficient search algorithm.</em></p>

<p><em>Example:</em></p>

<pre><code>Matrix: [  1,  2,  3,  5,  7 ]
        [  9, 11, 15, 19, 20 ]
        [ 23, 24, 25, 29, 31 ]
        [ 32, 33, 39, 40, 42 ]
        [ 45, 47, 48, 49, 50 ]

Input: 35
Output: 0 since it is missing in the matrix

Input: 39
Output: 1 as it exists in the matrix
</code></pre>

<p>We&#8217;re only trying to know whether an integer exists in the matrix. What I would normally do in such case is transform the data structure, i.e. store all the matrix items into a hash and then simply look whether an item exists in the hash. And I&#8217;ll also present such a solution.</p>

<p>However, looking carefully at the working of the task, we can see that the task insists on the fact that the integers are in ascending order from left to right and from top to bottom. The task further tells us that we should use an efficient algorithm. Although this is not explicitly specified, it is quite clear that we&#8217;re expected to implement a binary search algorithm, which is an efficient algorithm with sorted data.</p>

<p>The first idea might be to flatten the matrix into a one-dimension array, making the dataset much easier to use with a canonical binary search algorithm. But, obviously, that&#8217;s also not really what we&#8217;re expected to do. The task author wants us to implement a binary search algorithm on a 2-D matrix. We could come up with an &#8220;approximate&#8221; binary search, i.e. an heuristic looking for the approximate mid-point between two values. For example, we could start by testing any item on the third row and then goto the 2nd or 4th row depending on the result of the test. But that&#8217;s not satisfactory: that would not scale easily to other dimensions.</p>

<p>So I decided to perform the binary search on a list of consecutive integers between 0 and 24, and to provide a subroutine to convert these integers into 2-D indices. For example, the sixth item in that range corresponds to indices <code>[1][0]</code>.</p>

<h3>Search Matrix in Raku</h3>

<h4>Using Binary Search</h4>

<p>The <code>A2AoA</code> subroutine converts a flat rank into 2-D indices. We simply run a binary search on the <code>0..24</code> range and use the <code>A2AoA</code> subroutine to find out the correspond values in the matrix. Our test cases will be quite exhaustive, since we&#8217;ll be searching the matrix for every integer between 0 and 54.</p>

<pre><code>use v6;

my @matrix = (  1,  2,  3,  5,  7 ),
             (  9, 11, 15, 19, 20 ),
             ( 23, 24, 25, 29, 31 ),
             ( 32, 33, 39, 40, 42 ),
             ( 45, 47, 48, 49, 50 );

sub A2AoA ($index) {
    my ($i, $j) = $index.polymod(5).reverse;
}
sub binary ($in) {
    my ($min, $max) = 0, 24;
    while $max &gt; $min {
        my $pivot = (($max + $min) /2).Int;
        my ($i, $j) = A2AoA $pivot;
        my $val = @matrix[$i][$j];
        # say "val = $val, $i, $j";
        return 1 if $val == $in;
        if $in &gt; $val {

        } else {

        }
    }
    return 0;
}
say "$_ =&gt; ", binary $_ for 0..54;

<p>This program displays the following output:</p>

<p>Note that I&#8217;m happy that I used such exhaustive test cases, since my original implementation had a relatively rare bug that I had not seen with the six or seven values I initially tested.</p>

<h4>Using a Hash</h4>

<p>As I said in the introduction, in the real life, I would transform the input data into a hash and simply perform hash lookup.</p>

<pre><code>use v6;

my @matrix = (  1,  2,  3,  5,  7 ),
             (  9, 11, 15, 19, 20 ),
             ( 23, 24, 25, 29, 31 ),
             ( 32, 33, 39, 40, 42 ),
             ( 45, 47, 48, 49, 50 );

my %hash;
for @matrix -&gt; @row {
    %hash{$_} = 1 for @row;
}
say "$_ =&gt; ", %hash{$_} ?? 1 !! 0 for 0..54;
</code></pre>

<p>As it can be seen, the code is much shorter, much simpler and much less prone to errors. It produces the same output:</p>

<h3>Search Matrix in Perl</h3>

<h4>Using Binary Search</h4>

<p>This is a port to Perl of the binary search algorithm explained in the introduction above. The <code>A2AoA</code> subroutine converts a flat rank into 2-D indices. We simply run a binary search on the <code>0..24</code> range and use the <code>A2AoA</code> subroutine to find out the correspond values in the matrix. Our test cases will be quite exhaustive, since we&#8217;ll be searching the matrix for every integer between 0 and 54.</p>

<pre><code>use strict;
use warnings;
use feature "say";

my @matrix = ( [  1,  2,  3,  5,  7 ],
               [  9, 11, 15, 19, 20 ],
               [ 23, 24, 25, 29, 31 ],
               [ 32, 33, 39, 40, 42 ],
               [ 45, 47, 48, 49, 50 ]
             );

sub A2AoA {
    my $index = shift;
    my ($i, $j) = (int $index / 5, $index % 5);
}
sub bin_search {

    while ($max &gt; $min) {

        return 1 if $val == $in;
        if ($in &gt; $val) {
            $min = $pivot + 1;
        } else {
            $max = $pivot;
        }
    }
    return 0;
}
say "$_ =&gt; ", bin_search $_ for 0..54;

<h4>Using a Hash</h4>

<p>As mentioned above, in the real life, I would transform the input data into a hash and simply perform hash lookup. In Raku, I had to use nested <code>for</code> loops to populate the hash because my attempts using chained <code>map</code>s did not work as expected. There is certainly a way to do it with chained <code>map</code>s, but it is not easy to find the right syntax. No such problem with Perl where my chained <code>map</code>s worked perfectly on my first attempt (see below). There has to be something for which Perl is better or (more convenient) than Raku.</p>

<pre><code>use strict;
use warnings;
use feature "say";

my @matrix = ( [  1,  2,  3,  5,  7 ],
               [  9, 11, 15, 19, 20 ],
               [ 23, 24, 25, 29, 31 ],
               [ 32, 33, 39, 40, 42 ],
               [ 45, 47, 48, 49, 50 ]
             );

my %hash = map { $_ =&gt; 1 } map { @$_ } @matrix;
say "$_ =&gt; ", exists $hash{$_} ? 1 : 0 for 0..54;
</code></pre>

<p>This displays the same output as before:</p>

<h3>Search Matrix in Other Languages</h3>

<p>In Scala and Python, I&#8217;ll implement only the hash lookup strategy.</p>

<h4>Search Matrix in Scala</h4>

<p>In Scala, hashes are called &#8220;maps&#8221; but they behave essentuially the same way.</p>

<pre><code>object SearchItem extends App {
  val matrix = Array(
    Array(1, 2, 3, 5, 7),
    Array(9, 11, 15, 19, 20),
    Array(23, 24, 25, 29, 31),
    Array(32, 33, 39, 40, 42),
    Array(45, 47, 48, 49, 50)
  )

  var hash = scala.collection.mutable.Map[Int, Int]()
  for (row &lt;- matrix) {
    for (item &lt;- row) {
      hash(item) = 1
    }
  }

  for (i &lt;- 0 to 54) {
    if (hash.contains(i)) {
      println(s"$i =&gt; 1")
    } else {
      println(s"$i =&gt; 0")
    }
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Output:</p>

<p>0 => 0
1 => 1
2 => 1
3 => 1
4 => 0
&#8230; Lines omitted for brevity &#8230;
46 => 0
47 => 1
48 => 1
49 => 1
50 => 1
51 => 0
52 => 0
53 => 0
54 => 0</p>

<h4>Search Matrix in Python</h4>

<p>In Python, hashes are called dictionaries, and can be used the same way.</p>

<pre><code>matrix = ( [  1,  2,  3,  5,  7 ],
           [  9, 11, 15, 19, 20 ],
           [ 23, 24, 25, 29, 31 ],
           [ 32, 33, 39, 40, 42 ],
           [ 45, 47, 48, 49, 50 ]
         );

hash = {}
for row in matrix:
    for item in row:
        hash[item] = 1

for i in range(55):
    if i in hash:
        print(i, " =&gt; 1")
    else:
        print(i, " =&gt; 0")
</code></pre>

<p>Output:</p>

<pre><code>$ python3 ./search_item.py
0  =&gt; 0
1  =&gt; 1
2  =&gt; 1
3  =&gt; 1
4  =&gt; 0
5  =&gt; 1
... Lines omitted for brevity ...
45  =&gt; 1
46  =&gt; 0
47  =&gt; 1
48  =&gt; 1
49  =&gt; 1
50  =&gt; 1
51  =&gt; 0
52  =&gt; 0
53  =&gt; 0
54  =&gt; 0
</code></pre>

<h2>Task 2: Ordered Letters</h2>

<p><em>Given a word, you can sort its letters alphabetically (case insensitive). For example, “beekeeper” becomes “beeeeekpr” and “dictionary” becomes “acdiinorty”.</em></p>

<p><em>Write a script to find the longest English words that don’t change when their letters are sorted.</em></p>

<p>For this, I&#8217;ll use an English word list contributed to the public domain by Grady Ward as part of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moby_Project">Moby Lexicon</a> project. It is a list of 113,809 crosswords, that is words that are considered valid in crossword puzzles and other word games. The list can be found on my <a href="https://github.com/LaurentRosenfeld/think_raku/blob/master/Supplementary/words.txt">github repository</a>.</p>

<h3>Ordered Letters in Raku</h3>

<p>We don&#8217;t really need to sort the letters: we only need to know whether they are already in the alphabetical order. In Raku, we can use the <code>[...]</code> reduce metaoperator together with the <code>le</code> less than or equal to operator on the letters of the word. Checking whether a list is sorted has a smaller computational complexity than sorting the list, so this should presumably be faster (although it is so fast with my 113-k word list that it doesn&#8217;t really matter).</p>

<pre><code>use v6;

my @long-words;
my $max-length = 0;

for './words.txt'.IO.lines -&gt; $word {
    next unless [le] $word.comb;
    my $length = $word.chars;
    if  $length &gt; $max-length {
        @long-words = $word,;
        $max-length = $length;
    } elsif $length == $max-length {
        push @long-words, $word;
    }
}
say @long-words.join(", ");
</code></pre>

<p>This program finds two 7-letter words satisfying the task&#8217;s criteria and displays the following output:</p>

<pre><code>$ raku ./ordered-letters.raku
beefily, billowy
</code></pre>

<p>I do not know what these two words mean, but they are in the input list and they satisfy the criteria.</p>

<h3>Ordered Letters in Perl</h3>

<p>It is slightly less convenient in Perl than in Raku to check that the letters are already in the proper order, so I&#8217;ll simply sort the letters and compare the output with the input word.</p>

<pre><code>use strict;
use warnings;
use feature "say";

my @long_words;
my $max_length = 0;

my $word_list = "./words.txt";
open my $IN, "&lt;", $word_list or die "Cannot open $word_list $!";
while (my $word = &lt;$IN&gt;) {
    chomp $word;
    next unless $word eq join '', sort split //, $word;
    my $length = length $word;
    if  ($length &gt; $max_length) {
        @long_words = ($word);
        $max_length = $length;
    } elsif ($length == $max_length) {
        push @long_words, $word;
    }
}
say "@long_words";
</code></pre>

<p>This program produces the same two words:</p>

<pre><code>$ perl ordered-letters.pl
beefily billowy
</code></pre>

    <content type="html" xml:lang="en" xml:base="http://blogs.perl.org/users/neilb/">
        <![CDATA[<p>Dear TPF Board members,</p>

<p>We want to express our disappointment with the recent transparency reports and associated actions from the Community Affairs Team (CAT).</p>

<p>On Monday 19th March, a <a href="https://news.perlfoundation.org/post/cat-transparency-repor-19-april-2021">first Transparency Report</a> was issued, which said that an individual had been investigated for (1) behaviour on IRC and Twitter, and (2) behaviour at a Perl event in 2019. The report also reported that they had "found many instances of communication which alone may not have constituted unacceptable behavior, but when taken together did constitute unacceptable behavior", but no further details were given on those. The report issued a ban from all TPF events "in perpetuity", and furthermore issued a ban on the individual’s participation on irc.perl.org and any perl.org mailing lists. A second individual was issued a warning.</p>

<p>Prior to the 19th, one of the Perl Steering Council (PSC) members explicitly asked you not to issue a ban, saying that the PSC were already starting work on <a href="https://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl5.porters/2021/04/msg259909.html">improving discourse in and around p5p</a>. That person felt that a ban would be counterproductive when the PSC were trying to improve things in a more inclusive way. The second event was the Perl Toolchain Summit (PTS). The incident was investigated at the time, resulting in two of the organisers (Philippe Bruhat and Neil Bowers) asking the individual to leave. He left peacefully, expressing regret that he had upset and offended the other party. The PTS is <em>not</em> a TPF event.</p>

<p>Nearly two weeks after the initial report, TPF issued a <a href="https://news.perlfoundation.org/post/cat-transparency-report-updates0">Transparency Report Update</a>, which retracted parts of the first report, but left other parts hazy. For example, the first report mentions other "unacceptable behaviour", but gives no further details in either report. The warning for the second individual was retracted.</p>

<p>The use of "transparency" seems incongruous:</p>

<ul>
<li>No charter for the CAT had been published, nor a common set of guidelines as the basis of triggering investigations or taking corrective actions.</li>
<li>No definition for “unacceptable behavior” was provided.</li>
<li>The CAT did not talk to the relevant communities or their leaders before publishing the initial report.</li>
<li>The CAT had not spoken to either person investigated prior to publishing the first report.</li>
</ul>

<p>These behaviours don't demonstrate the values and behaviours that we could reasonably expect of a body investigating community affairs. As the most visible and official Perl organization, TPF should hold itself to a higher standard.</p>

<p>This felt like a clumsy attempt by TPF to establish control over all Perl communities, and only when you got push-back did you attempt to wind some of that back. You do not have jurisdiction over IRC, email lists, or most other parts of our communities. It is not TPF/CAT’s role  to request that people stop participating. We have not given you consent to unilaterally define policy across our communities, nor impose punishments on behalf of them.</p>

<p>We are all firm supporters of codes of conduct, where the goal is to set expectations for behaviour. Many of our individual communities have long defined and enforced their own guidelines and standards of conduct. That said, we believe that our communities could benefit from harmonising standards. This was an opportunity for TPF/CAT to demonstrate leadership, and start bringing our communities together towards a unified policy. Instead the TPF acted seemingly without consideration for the varied needs and devolved leadership of the communities it purports to represent.</p>

<p>This is not to say that we condone the individual's behaviour. Some signatories to this letter were part of the governing bodies that issued the initial corrective actions on the two incidents the CAT cited. We also do not want to diminish the upset and offence that the individual has caused to a number of people over the years.</p>

<p>We would like to see TPF acknowledge its failings in how this has been handled, and make changes to ensure these aren't repeated, but we're not looking for a blood-letting and further division. We would like to see this debacle as a catalyst for our communities coming together to move things forward. We need to clarify the organisation and governance structures of our communities, and start the process of defining common values and expectations around behaviour. This needs to be a community-led activity: given recent events, we don't feel that TPF/CAT is currently fit for a leadership role in this, but we would absolutely want your participation.</p>

<p>In volunteer communities such as ours, leadership is about doing the hard work of building consensus, not imposing your will on the rest of us. Leadership should be a service we provide to our communities.</p>

<p>Signed</p>

        <![CDATA[<p>Gee almost a year since my lat post.    I better start posting again or Mohammad  will catch up with me ;).</p>

<p>Been quite a year for every one on this big blue marble.  I hope you are all good.</p>

<p>Ok here is the very short post for today.</p>

<p>I just did my first build and upload of <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/release/BYTEROCK/Paws-0.43/lib/Paws.pm">PAWS</a> to CPAN</p>

<p>Expect Version 0.43 to be up there later today some time.</p>

<p>It was a bit of an epic on my part as this whole releasing thingy, made some real bad goofs (deleting then checking in a folder), thank goodness for 'git revert'  and getting the version number wrong.</p>

<p>Hopefully is comes out ok.</p>

<p>Look for more releases in the future.</p>

    <title>Checking Phone Numbers and Transposing Tabular Data the Hard Way: The Weekly Challenge 110</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://www.rabbitfarm.com/cgi-bin/blosxom/2021/05/02#pwc110" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The examples used here are from the weekly challenge problem statement and demonstrate the working solution.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="part-1"&gt;Part 1&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You are given a text file. Write a script to display all valid phone numbers in the given text file.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="solution"&gt;Solution&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="perl"&gt;
use Capture::Tiny q/capture_stdout/;
use PhoneNumberParser;

MAIN:{
    my $parser = new PhoneNumberParser();
    while(my $line = &lt;DATA&gt;){
        $line =~ s/^\s+|\s+$//g;
        my $syntax_error = capture_stdout {
            $parser-&gt;parse($line); 
        };
        print("$line\n") if !$syntax_error;
    }
}   

__DATA__
0044 1148820341
 +44 1148820341
  44-11-4882-0341
(44) 1148820341

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Parse::Yapp"&gt;Parse::Yapp&lt;/a&gt; grammar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="perl"&gt;
%token SPACE DIGIT OPEN CLOSE PLUS

;

prefix: DIGIT DIGIT DIGIT DIGIT
    | OPEN DIGIT DIGIT CLOSE
    | PLUS DIGIT DIGIT

sub lexer{
    my($parser) = @_;
    $parser-&gt;YYData-&gt;{INPUT} or return('', undef);
    ##
    # send tokens to parser
    ##
    for($parser-&gt;YYData-&gt;{INPUT}){
        s/^(\s)// and return ("SPACE", $1);
        s/^(\d)// and return ("DIGIT", $1);
        s/^(\()// and return ("OPEN", $1);
        s/^(\))// and return ("CLOSE", $1);
        s/^(\+)// and return ("PLUS", $1);
    }  
}

sub error{
    exists $_[0]-&gt;YYData-&gt;{ERRMSG}
    and do{
        print $_[0]-&gt;YYData-&gt;{ERRMSG};
            return;
    };
    print "syntax error\n"; 
}

sub parse{
    my($self, $input) = @_;
    $self-&gt;YYData-&gt;{INPUT} = $input;
    my $result = $self-&gt;YYParse(yylex =&gt; \&amp;lexer, yyerror =&gt; \&amp;error);
    return $result;  
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3 id="sample-run"&gt;Sample Run&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="shell"&gt;
$ yapp perl/PhoneNumberParser.yp
$ perl -Iperl perl/ch-1.pl

(44) 1148820341
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3 id="notes"&gt;Notes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While a set of regular expression would have done the job quite nicely I figured I’d use this problem as a reason to shake the rust off my grammar writing skills. Not that I am a master parser writer or anything, but &lt;a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Parse::Yapp"&gt;Parse::Yapp&lt;/a&gt; makes it easy enough!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, easy is a bit relative I suppose. This is definitely not the simplest way of performing this task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="part-2"&gt;Part 2&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You are given a text file. Write a script to transpose the contents of the given file.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="solution-1"&gt;Solution&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="perl"&gt;
sub transpose{
    my @columns = @_;
    return transpose_r([], \@columns);  
}

sub transpose_r{
    my($transposed, $remaining) = @_;
    return $transposed if(@{$remaining} == 0);   
    $transposed = transpose_row_r($transposed, $remaining-&gt;[0]);  
    shift @{$remaining}; 
    transpose_r($transposed, $remaining);  
}

sub transpose_row_r{
    my($transposed, $row) = @_;
    return $transposed if(@{$row} == 0); 
    my $index = @{$row} - 1;
    push @{$transposed-&gt;[$index]}, pop @{$row};  
    transpose_row_r($transposed, $row);    
}

MAIN:{
    my @columns;
    while(my $line = &lt;DATA&gt;){
        chomp($line);
        my @fields = split(/,/, $line);   
        push @columns, \@fields; 
    }
    my $transposed = transpose(@columns);   
    for my $i (0 .. @{$transposed} - 1){
        print join(",", @{$transposed-&gt;[$i]}) . "\n";       
    }    
}

__DATA__
name,age,sex
Mohammad,45,m
Joe,20,m
Julie,35,f
Cristina,10,f
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3 id="sample-run-1"&gt;Sample Run&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="shell"&gt;
$ perl perl/ch-2.pl
name,Mohammad,Joe,Julie,Cristina
age,45,20,35,10
sex,m,m,f,f
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3 id="notes-1"&gt;Notes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similar to Part 1 this is also not the easiest way to perform this task. Here the same sort of recursion is used that is used in the &lt;a href="http://www.rabbitfarm.com/cgi-bin/blosxom/prolog/2021/05/02"&gt;Prolog version&lt;/a&gt; of the solution to this part. That is, we recurse over the table itself and then for each row perform a separate recursion to perform the transpostion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="references"&gt;References&lt;/h2&gt;

    <category term="perl"/>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Today I was invited to join &lt;a href="https://szabgab.com/"&gt;Gabor Szabo&lt;/a&gt; for a &lt;a href="https://code-maven.com/setting-up-ci-and-docker-for-course-management-app"&gt;live pair programming session&lt;/a&gt;, where we worked on adding Docker and CI to his &lt;a href="https://github.com/szabgab/course-management"&gt;course management application&lt;/a&gt;. You can view the video of our informal competition who is the worst typist &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byugeGi1cNc"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At first I was bit skeptical about the concept of live coding (who wants to watch people google^w code for two hours?), but in the end it was a funny and informative (for me) session. Maybe I'm just totally deprived of live human interaction (thanks, Corona), but I think I'd enjoy similar sessions also under normal circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Things I learned&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I forgot a lot of docker command line options after mostly using docker-compose.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is no really smooth way to &lt;code&gt;COPY&lt;/code&gt; a lot of dirs into the container.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adding a &lt;code&gt;.dockerignore&lt;/code&gt; file (to ignore at least &lt;code&gt;~/.git/&lt;/code&gt;) saves some time and network, because docker will not send the ignored files to the docker daemon in the famous &lt;code&gt;sending build context to docker daemon&lt;/code&gt; step at the start of each build.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;-P&lt;/code&gt; exposes the ports listed in &lt;code&gt;EXPOSE&lt;/code&gt;, but maps them to random ports on the host (which makes no sense during dev, but probably when deploying to clouds)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some people prefer &lt;code&gt;-ti&lt;/code&gt;, some prefer &lt;code&gt;-it&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I'm a bit rusty on using the github pull request workflow (esp. the part where you have to fetch upgrades from upstream), due to mostly working on repos where several devs have direct write access.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Setting up github CI is really not a lot of work (at least to only run the basic tests). Only &lt;a href="https://github.com/szabgab/course-management/commit/2bfb424f8e1b14481def0886a198f4715cff5f8a"&gt;16 lines of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;YAML&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. I will try to add this to my &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CPAN &lt;/span&gt;github repos.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you're interested in the Dockerfile aspect of this session, may I point you to my talk &lt;a href="/talks/writing_a_good_dockerfile_for_perl_app.html"&gt;Writing a good Dockerfile for a (Perl) app&lt;/a&gt; from the 2020 Perl Conference, where I elaborate on some of the finer points, and with better preparation than today :-)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, and this reminds me that I should submit a talk (maybe on docker-compose?) for &lt;a href="https://perlconference.us/tprc-2021-cloud/"&gt;this years Perl &amp;amp; Raku conference&lt;/a&gt;. The CfP runs until tomorrow, so I better hurry.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Downloading and Installing Perl in 2021</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://perl.com/article/downloading-and-installing-perl-in-2021/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;[This article is part of our &lt;a href="https://github.com/tpf/perldotcom/projects/1"&gt;Popular articles&lt;/a&gt; project to update
Perl.com for contemporary practices]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re reading this article, you&amp;rsquo;re likely looking for a simple way
to download and install the Perl programming language. Or you already
have Perl installed as part of your operating system, but it&amp;rsquo;s older
than the currently-supported versions (5.32.1 or 5.30.3) and you&amp;rsquo;d
like to use the latest and greatest features. &lt;a href="https://www.perl.org/get.html"&gt;The download
options&lt;/a&gt; may seem daunting, especially
if you&amp;rsquo;re new to computers or programming. We&amp;rsquo;ll take things step by
step, and soon you&amp;rsquo;ll be on your way to writing your first Perl
program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A word of warning, though: Several of these steps (and usually Perl
itself) require using your computer&amp;rsquo;s command-line or terminal
interface.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="the-first-step-download-pre-built"&gt;The first step: Download pre-built&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re getting started in Perl development, you may only need a
pre-built binary distribution. Further on, though, you might want to
consider building your own, especially if you need to juggle different
versions to support different environments or want to use a later
version than is available pre-made.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For now, though, let&amp;rsquo;s consider the pre-built options. You have
several, depending on what computer operating system you&amp;rsquo;re using.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="microsoft-windows"&gt;Microsoft Windows&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two main &amp;ldquo;flavors&amp;rdquo; of Perl for Windows are
&lt;a href="https://www.activestate.com/products/perl/"&gt;ActiveState Perl&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a href="https://strawberryperl.com/"&gt;Strawberry Perl&lt;/a&gt;. Which one you choose depends
on what you plan to use it for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ActiveState&lt;/strong&gt; provides a
&lt;a href="https://www.activestate.com/products/perl/downloads/"&gt;free community edition of ActivePerl&lt;/a&gt;
licensed only for development purposes. If you intend to do
commercial work or want technical support beyond community forums, you&amp;rsquo;ll
need to
&lt;a href="https://www.activestate.com/solutions/pricing/"&gt;subscribe to a team plan or higher&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The free community edition is also 64-bit only, and as of this writing, only
the earlier versions 5.28 (2018) and 5.26 (2017) are available, with an
experimental 5.32 (2020) release licensed for any purpose. The latter is
also currently only installable via the Windows command line; earlier
versions use a standard Windows setup wizard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://strawberryperl.com/"&gt;Strawberry Perl&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; is a Perl environment for
Windows that strives to be as close as possible to Perl on Unix and Linux
systems, where the language got its start. Besides the Perl binaries, it
also includes a compiler, related tools, external libraries, and database
clients. This is important as many modules for extending Perl&amp;rsquo;s
functionality need a compiler. It&amp;rsquo;s also available in both 64-bit and
32-bit editions of the current 5.32 version.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What do I recommend?&lt;/strong&gt; There&amp;rsquo;s no escaping Perl&amp;rsquo;s Unix heritage, so you&amp;rsquo;ll
have an easier time with Strawberry Perl. That said, if you think you&amp;rsquo;ll be
taking advantage of ActiveState&amp;rsquo;s commercial offerings of support and their
&lt;a href="https://www.activestate.com/products/platform/"&gt;ActiveState Platform&lt;/a&gt; for
managing different language runtimes, you may want to give them a try.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Windows also has two Linux-like environments in the form of
&lt;a href="https://www.cygwin.com/"&gt;Cygwin&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/"&gt;Windows Subsystem for Linux&lt;/a&gt;.
Follow the Linux directions below to install Perl in one of these.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is also the &lt;a href="https://chocolatey.org/"&gt;Chocolatey&lt;/a&gt; package manager for
Windows, which provides an option for installing either ActiveState or
Strawberry Perl.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="apple-macos"&gt;Apple macOS&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;macOS comes with Perl pre-installed: version
5.18 (2013) on macOS Catalina 10.15 and 5.28 (2018) on Big Sur 11. But,
&lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/macos-release-notes/macos-catalina-10_15-release-notes#Scripting-Language-Runtimes"&gt;Apple has said that scripting language runtimes are deprecated&lt;/a&gt;,
and are only &amp;ldquo;included &amp;hellip; for compatibility with legacy software.&amp;rdquo; You
should consider installing your own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like Windows, ActiveState has a
&lt;a href="https://www.activestate.com/products/perl/downloads/"&gt;free community edition&lt;/a&gt;
for developers. The Windows caveats above apply, except for a current Perl
version 5.32—it&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;coming soon&amp;rdquo; as of this writing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your best bet is to &lt;a href="https://brew.sh/"&gt;install the Homebrew package manager&lt;/a&gt;
in the macOS Terminal application (after
&lt;a href="https://docs.brew.sh/Installation#macos-requirements"&gt;installing its requirements&lt;/a&gt;),
and then issue the command &lt;code&gt;brew install perl&lt;/code&gt;. This will install the latest
version of Perl, as well as give you instructions for making sure that
installed Perl modules stay that way across updates by Homebrew.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="linux-or-another-unix-like-system"&gt;Linux or another Unix-like system&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like macOS, most Linux and Unix
systems come with Perl pre-installed, or installable using the operating
system&amp;rsquo;s software package manager. Also like macOS, these are usually older
versions provided for compatibility with other software provided by the
OS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To install your own on Linux, you can
&lt;a href="https://www.activestate.com/products/perl/downloads/"&gt;go the ActiveState route&lt;/a&gt;
as above, or also use the
&lt;a href="https://docs.brew.sh/Homebrew-on-Linux"&gt;Homebrew package manager&lt;/a&gt;. There are
&lt;a href="https://docs.brew.sh/Homebrew-on-Linux#requirements"&gt;several requirements to install first&lt;/a&gt;,
and then you can
&lt;a href="https://brew.sh/"&gt;follow the directions for installing Homebrew&lt;/a&gt; and issue
the command &lt;code&gt;brew install perl&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For other Unix systems with an older version of Perl, I&amp;rsquo;m afraid you&amp;rsquo;re going
to have to build from source as detailed below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="next-steps-building-your-own-with-perlbrew-or-plenv"&gt;Next steps: Building your own with perlbrew or plenv&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perl&amp;rsquo;s source code (the instructions that build a program) is freely
available and compiles on &lt;a href="https://perldoc.pl/perlport#PLATFORMS"&gt;over 100
platforms&lt;/a&gt;. You can &lt;a href="https://www.perl.org/get.html"&gt;download
it directly&lt;/a&gt; and build a version
yourself, after installing any prerequisite packages used to build
software on your operating system (see below). However, most Perl
developers choose to use a tool to automate that process and manage
different versions of Perl side-by-side. Enter
&lt;a href="https://perlbrew.pl/"&gt;perlbrew&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perlbrew requires an already-installed system version of Perl, but it
can be as old as 5.8 (2002), which should cover most Linux and Unix
systems in use today. Once you&amp;rsquo;ve installed your operating system&amp;rsquo;s
build tools and followed the directions on &lt;a href="https://perlbrew.pl/"&gt;the perlbrew home
page&lt;/a&gt;, typing &lt;code&gt;perlbrew install 5.32.1&lt;/code&gt; followed
by &lt;code&gt;perlbrew switch 5.32.1&lt;/code&gt; will install and switch to the latest
version of Perl as of this writing. Installing older versions of Perl
and switching between them use the same steps, e.g.:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"&gt;&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"&gt;perlbrew install &lt;span style="color:#ae81ff"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;.30.3 --as older-perl
perlbrew switch older-perl&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I use an alternative, &lt;a href="https://github.com/tokuhirom/plenv"&gt;plenv&lt;/a&gt;,
which uses a different mechanism to manage versions of Perl using the &lt;code&gt;bash&lt;/code&gt;
command shell. It also enables you to use different versions of Perl depending
on which file system directory you&amp;rsquo;re working in. It&amp;rsquo;s
&lt;a href="https://github.com/tokuhirom/plenv/blob/master/README.md#installation"&gt;set up&lt;/a&gt;
using either Homebrew or &lt;code&gt;git&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Windows users have the option of
&lt;a href="https://github.com/stevieb9/berrybrew"&gt;berrybrew&lt;/a&gt;, which acts much like
perlbrew for Strawberry Perl with slightly different
&lt;a href="https://github.com/stevieb9/berrybrew#commands"&gt;options&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="building-from-the-source-directly"&gt;Building from the source directly&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you feel you don&amp;rsquo;t need to manage multiple installations of Perl or you
want to do things old-school, you can always download and build directly from
the source code. Select &amp;ldquo;Download Latest Stable Source&amp;rdquo; from the
&lt;a href="https://www.perl.org/get.html"&gt;Perl Download&lt;/a&gt; web page, then
&lt;a href="https://opensource.com/article/17/7/how-unzip-targz-file"&gt;unarchive it&lt;/a&gt;
into a directory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should always check the included &lt;code&gt;README&lt;/code&gt; files for information on how to
build on your system; there&amp;rsquo;s a generic one as well as specific &lt;code&gt;README&lt;/code&gt;s for
various platforms (&lt;code&gt;README.linux&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;README.macosx&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;README.win32&lt;/code&gt;, etc.).
Note that the &lt;code&gt;README.macosx&lt;/code&gt; document applies to current versions of macOS,
which was previously called Mac OS X; &lt;code&gt;README.macos&lt;/code&gt; is for the &amp;ldquo;Classic&amp;rdquo;
Macintosh operating system, unsupported since 2004.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On most Unix-like systems (including macOS), you can then configure, build,
test, and install Perl by issuing the following commands:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"&gt;&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"&gt;./Configure -des -Dprefix&lt;span style="color:#f92672"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;/usr/local/
make
make test
sudo make install&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will build Perl with all default options for your system and install it
in the &lt;code&gt;/usr/local&lt;/code&gt; directory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="up-and-running"&gt;Up and running&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regardless of whether you&amp;rsquo;ve chosen to install a pre-built package or roll
your own, you should now be able to issue the following at your command line:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"&gt;&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"&gt;perl -v&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;hellip;and receive a reply that looks something like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;This is perl 5, version 32, subversion 1 (v5.32.1) built for darwin-2level
(with 1 registered patch, see perl -V for more detail)

    <title>Chowla Numbers and Numbers in Boxes: The Weekly Challenge 109</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://www.rabbitfarm.com/cgi-bin/blosxom/2021/04/25#pwc109" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The examples used here are from the weekly challenge problem statement and demonstrate the working solution.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="part-1"&gt;Part 1&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Write a script to display the first 20 Chowla Numbers.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="solution"&gt;Solution&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="perl"&gt;
use strict;
use warnings;
use constant CHOWLA_COUNT =&gt; 20;
sub factor{
    my($n) = @_;
    my @factors = ();
    foreach my $j (2..sqrt($n)){
        push @factors, $j if $n % $j == 0;
        push @factors, ($n / $j) if $n % $j == 0 &amp;&amp; $j ** 2 != $n;
    }    
    return @factors;  
}

sub chowla{
    my(@factors) = @_;
    my $sum = unpack("%32I*", pack("I*", @factors)); 
}

MAIN:{
    my @chowla_numbers;
    for my $n (1 .. CHOWLA_COUNT){
        push @chowla_numbers, chowla(factor($n));
    }
    print join(", ", @chowla_numbers) . "\n"; 
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3 id="sample-run"&gt;Sample Run&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="shell"&gt;
$ perl perl/ch-1.pl
0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 5, 0, 6, 3, 7, 0, 15, 0, 9, 8, 14, 0, 20, 0, 21
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3 id="notes"&gt;Notes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This code borrowed quite a bit a previous challenge involving &lt;a href="https://adamcrussell.livejournal.com/2607.html"&gt;Perfect Numbers&lt;/a&gt;. Indeed, the code is nearly identical! After we get the factors there is only the matter of summing them and displaying them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="part-2"&gt;Part 2&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Place the given unique numbers in the square box so that sum of numbers in each box is the same.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="solution-1"&gt;Solution&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h3 id="notes-1"&gt;Notes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This sort of problem practically screams out for a Prolog solution! In the interest of keeping with the name, if not the spirit of the weekly challenge, this first part is indeed Perl, albeit using AI::Prolog, a module which offers a pure Perl implementation of a basic Prolog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have used AI::Prolog &lt;a href="https://adamcrussell.livejournal.com/14361.html"&gt;previously&lt;/a&gt; and it’s a neat way to take advantage of Prolog within a Perl based solution. The two main downsides are that (1) it is not a full ISO Prolog and (2) it is slow. So very very slow. I suspect, in fact, there is a serious bug in the implementation. Even accounting for the fact that a pure Perl Prolog would be much slower than one written in C, such as Gnu Prolog, the execution time differences are laughably dramatic. I didn’t bother with precise metrics but the code above takes about an hour to run on fairly current hardware (i.e. my 2018 Mac Mini). Essentially the same code run on the same hardware but with Gnu Prolog completes in mere seconds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, this is a nice way to incorporate a bit of Symbolic AI in a Perl code base if there is a small search space. Say, for some simple game logic or a small chat bot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.rabbitfarm.com/cgi-bin/blosxom/prolog/2021/04/25"&gt;pure Prolog solution&lt;/a&gt; I did for this uses the same approach, in part, although I also wrote this to take advantage of Gnu Prolog’s FD solver. The FD version of the code completes in about 10ms!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="references"&gt;References&lt;/h2&gt;
